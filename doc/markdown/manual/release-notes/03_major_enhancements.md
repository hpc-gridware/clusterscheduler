# Major Enhancements

## v9.1.0

### Munge authentication

The Gridware Cluster Scheduler now supports Munge authentication. Munge is a lightweight authentication service that
provides a secure way to authenticate users and services, see [https://dun.github.io/munge/](https://dun.github.io/munge/).

Munge is used to authenticate users in a xxQS_NAMExx cluster.  
Munge authentication can be enabled at installation time or later by modifying the bootstrap file and re-starting all xxQS_NAMExx components.

See details in the Installation Guide, chapters "Planning the Installation" and "Installing Munge".
