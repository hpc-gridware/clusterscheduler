# Introduction

HPC-Gridware is dedicated to delivering regular releases of reliable, high-quality software products optimized for modern computing platforms suitable for engineering simulations and artificial intelligence. By tracking industry trends and customer requirements, we identify the most effective platforms to certify and support, while phasing out outdated platforms and introducing support for emerging ones. This document outlines our current platform support strategy, near-term objectives, and provides insights into our product roadmap.

Versioning of software products created by HPC-Gridware adhere to the *semantic versioning scheme*, where version numbers are formatted as three digits separated by dots (e.g., v9.0.5). The first digit represents the *major* version, the second the *minor* version, and the third the *patch level*.
Changes in the *major* version may introduce incompatibilities. Variations in the *minor* version typically indicate new features while maintaining backward compatibility. Adjustments to the *patch level* are limited to fixes that do not alter the public interface of products.

> **Important**
> 
> This document is specific to version v9.0.x of HPC-Gridware's product suite and describes the functionality of its components. If you are using or planning to use a different major or minor version, please refer to the corresponding `Platforms Guide` or contact our sales or support team for assistance.
