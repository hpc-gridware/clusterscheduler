# Maintenance, Support and Release Schedule

Major and minor releases of Gridware Cluster Scheduler are typically maintained by HPC-Gridware for three years following their First Customer Shipment (FCS).

- **First Customer Shipment (FCS):** 
  The date when the first customer receives a product.
- **Phase 1 (Year 1):** 
  New functionality may be introduced through patch releases additionally to fixes and security updates.
- **Phase 2 (Year 2):** 
  Patch releases will focus mainly on bug fixes and security updates.
- **Phase 3 (Year 3):** 
  Only critical bug fixes and security updates will be provided.
- **End of Life (EOL):** 
  Maintenance ended and no further support will be provided. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version.

Users of the Open Cluster Scheduler and customers without a support contract receive access to patch releases to the extent required by law.

Customers of Gridware Cluster Scheduler get access to all licensed software releases, including those that introduce new functionality as well as fixes and security updates, as long as they have a support contract and as long as the product version is within the maintenance window (EOL has not been reached). Support will be provided according to the terms of the support contract.

Customers requiring the use of a specific major version of a software product beyond the maintenance window, can extend Phase 3 of the last minor release for up to three years (two additional years), subject to agreement in the support contract.

FCS dates for major and minor releases are usually scheduled for Q3 or Q4 of a year which means that EOL dates are usually three years and one day after FCS.
