# Build and Installation

Build the 3rdparty dependencies with

```
make 3rdparty
```

After that you can build the xxQS_NAMExx product.

```
make 
```

Now you can install the required components to the specified target location.

```
make install
```

You can now either install the product (follow the instructions in the *Installation Guide*) or you can continue to 
setup the automated test environment as described in the next chapter.
