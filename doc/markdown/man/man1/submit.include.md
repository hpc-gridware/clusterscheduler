# DESCRIPTION

`qsub` submits batch jobs to the xxQS_NAMExx queuing system. xxQS_NAMExx supports single- and multiple-node jobs. 
*Command* can be a path to a binary or a script (see `-b` below) which contains the commands to be run by the job 
using a shell (for example, sh(1) or csh(1)). Arguments to the command are given as *command_args* to `qsub`. If
*command* is handled as a script then it is possible to embed flags in the script. If the first two characters of 
a script line either match '#$' or are equal to the prefix string defined with the `-C` option described below, 
the line is parsed for embedded command flags.

`Qsh` submits an interactive X-windows session to xxQS_NAMExx. A xterm(1) is brought up from the executing machine 
with the display directed either to the X-server indicated by the DISPLAY environment variable or as specified with 
the `-display` `qsh` option. Interactive jobs are not spooled if no resource is available to execute them. They
are either dispatched to a suitable machine for execution immediately or the user submitting the job is notified by 
`qsh` that appropriate resources to execute the job are not available. *xterm_args* are passed to the xterm(1) 
executable. Note, however, that the `-e` and `-ls` xterm options do not work with `qsh`.

`qlogin` is similar to *qsh* in that it submits an interactive job to the queuing system. It does not open a xterm(1) 
window on the X display, but uses the current terminal for user I/O. Usually, `qlogin` establishes a connection with 
the remote host, using standard client- and server-side commands. These commands can be configured with the 
*qlogin_daemon* (server-side, xxQS_NAMExx *telnetd* if not set, otherwise something like /usr/sbin/in.telnetd) and
*qlogin_command* (client-side, xxQS_NAMExx *telnet* if not set, otherwise something like /usr/bin/telnet) 
parameters in the global and local configuration settings of xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5). The client side command is 
automatically parameterized with the remote host name and port number to which to connect, resulting in an 
invocation like

    /usr/bin/telnet my_exec_host 2442

for example. `qlogin` is invoked exactly like `qsh` and its jobs can only run on INTERACTIVE queues. `qlogin` jobs 
can only be used if the xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) is running under the root account.

`qrsh` is similar to `qlogin` in that it submits an interactive job to the queuing system. It uses the current 
terminal for user I/O. Usually, `qrsh` establishes a rsh(1) connection with the remote host. If no
command is given to `qrsh`, an rlogin(1) session is established. The server-side commands used can be configured with 
the *rsh_daemon* and *rlogin_daemon* parameters in the global and local configuration settings of xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5). 
An xxQS_NAMExx `rshd` or `rlogind` is used if the parameters are not set. If the parameters are set, they should be 
set to something like `/usr/sbin/in.rshd` or `/usr/sbin/in.rlogind`. On the client-side, the *rsh_command* and
*rlogin_command* parameters can be set in the global and local configuration settings of xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5). If 
they are not set, special xxQS_NAMExx rsh(1) and rlogin(1) binaries delivered with xxQS_NAMExx are used. Use the 
cluster configuration parameters to integrate mechanisms like `ssh` or the rsh(1) and rlogin(1) facilities supplied 
with the operating system.

`qrsh` jobs can only run in INTERACTIVE queues unless the option `-now no` is used (see below). They can also only be 
run if the xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) is running under the root account.

`qrsh` provides an additional useful feature for integrating with interactive tools providing a specific command 
shell. If the environment variable *QRSH_WRAPPER* is set when `qrsh` is invoked, the command interpreter pointed 
to by *QRSH_WRAPPER* will be executed to run `qrsh` commands instead of the users login shell or any shell specified
in the `qrsh` command-line.

`qalter` can be used to change the attributes of pending jobs. For array jobs with a mix of running and pending 
tasks (see the `-t` option below), modification with `qalter` only affects the pending tasks. `qalter` can change 
most of the characteristics of a job (see the corresponding statements in the OPTIONS section below), including those
which were defined as embedded flags in the script file (see above). Some submit options, such as the job script, 
cannot be changed with `qalter`.

`qresub` allows the user to create jobs as copies of existing pending or running jobs. The copied jobs will have 
exactly the same attributes as the ones from which they were copied, except with a new job ID and with
a cleared hold state. The only modification to the copied jobs supported by `qresub` is assignment of a new hold 
state with the `-h` option. This option can be used to first copy a job and then change its attributes via `qalter`.

Only a manager can use `qresub` on jobs submitted by another user. Regular users can only use `qresub` on their own jobs.

For `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, and `qlogin` the administrator and the user may define default request files (see 
xxqs_name_sxx_request(5)) which can contain any of the options described below. If an option in a default request 
file is understood by `qsub` and `qlogin` but not by `qsh` the option is silently ignored if `qsh` is invoked. 
Thus you can maintain shared default request files for both `qsub` and `qsh`.

A cluster wide default request file may be placed under $xxQS_NAME_Sxx_ROOT/$xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL/common/xxqs_name_sxx_request.
User private default request files are processed under the locations $HOME/.xxqs_name_sxx_request and 
$cwd/.xxqs_name_sxx_request. The working directory local default request file has the highest precedence,
then the home directory located file and then the cluster global file. The option arguments, the embedded script 
flags and the options in the default request files are processed in the following order:

* left to right in the script line, 
* left to right in the default request files, 
* from top to bottom of the script file (`qsub` only), 
* from top to bottom of default request files, 
* from left to right of the command line.

In other words, the command line can be used to override the embedded flags and the default request settings. 
The embedded flags, however, will override the default settings.

Note, that the `-clear` option can be used to discard any previous settings at any time in a default request file, 
in the embedded script flags, or in a command-line option. It is, however, not available with `qalter`.

The options described below can be requested either hard or soft. By default, all requests are considered hard 
until the `-soft` option (see below) is encountered. The hard/soft status remains in effect until its counterpart 
is encountered again. If all the hard requests for a job cannot be met, the job will not be scheduled. Jobs which 
cannot be run at the present time remain spooled.

# OPTIONS

## -@ *optionfile*

Forces `qsub`, `qrsh`, `qsh`, or `qlogin` to use the options contained in *optionfile*. The indicated file may 
contain all valid options. Comment lines must start with a "#" sign.

## -a *date_time*

Available for `qsub` and `qalter` only.

Defines or redefines the time and date at which a job is eligible for execution. *Date_time* conforms to 

    [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]

For the details, please see *date_time* in: xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

If this option is used with `qsub` then a parameter named *a* and the value in the format CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS will be 
passed to the defined JSV instances (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in 
xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -ac *variable*\[=*value*\],...

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Adds the given name/value pair(s) to the job's context. *Value* may be omitted. xxQS_NAMExx appends the given 
argument to the list of context variables for the job. Multiple `-ac`, `-dc`, and `-sc` options may be given. 
The order is important here.

The outcome of the evaluation of all `-ac`, `-dc`, and `-sc` is passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the 
name *ac*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

`qlater` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

## -ar *ar_id*  

Available for `qsub`, `qalter`, `qrsh`, `qsh`, or `qlogin` only.

Assigns the submitted job to be a part of an existing Advance Reservation. The complete list of existing 
Advance Reservations can be obtained using the qrstat(1) command.

Note that the `-ar` option adds implicitly the `-w e` option if not otherwise requested.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*ar*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -A *account_string*

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Identifies the account to which the resource consumption of the job should be charged. The *account_string* should 
conform to the *name* definition in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1) . In the absence of this parameter xxQS_NAMExx will place 
the default account string "ocs" in the accounting record of the job.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*A*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -binding [ *binding_instance* ] *binding_strategy*

A job can request a specific processor core binding (processor affinity) with this parameter. This request is 
neither a hard nor a soft request, it is a hint for the execution host to do this if possible. Please note
that the requested binding strategy is not used for resource selection within xxQS_NAMExx. As a result an 
execution host might be selected where xxQS_NAMExx does not even know the hardware topology and therefore
is not able to apply the requested binding.

To enforce xxQS_NAMExx to select hardware on which the binding can be applied please use the `-l` switch in 
combination with the complex attribute *m_topology*.

*binding_instance* is an optional parameter. It might either be *env*, *pe* or *set* depending on which instance 
should accomplish the job to core binding. If the value for *binding_instance* is not specified then *set* will be used.

*env* means that the environment variable *SGE_BINDING* will be exported to the job environment of the job. 
This variable contains the selected operating system internal processor numbers. They might be more than selected 
cores in presence of SMT or CMT because each core could be represented by multiple processor identifiers. 
The processor numbers are space separated.

*pe* means that the information about the selected cores appears in the fourth column of the *pe_hostfile*. Here the 
logical core and socket numbers are printed (they start at 0 and have no holes) in colon separated pairs 
(i.e. 0,0:1,0 which means core 0 on socket 0 and core 0 on socket 1). For more information about the $pe_hostfile check
xxqs_name_sxx_pe(5)

*set* (default if nothing else is specified). The binding strategy is applied by xxQS_NAMExx. How this is achieved 
depends on the underlying hardware architecture of the execution host where the submitted job will be started.

On Solaris hosts a processor set will be created where the job can exclusively run in. Because of operating 
system limitations at least one core must remain unbound. This resource could of course used by an unbound job.

On Linux hosts a processor affinity mask will be set to restrict the job to run exclusively on the selected cores. 
The operating system allows other unbound processes to use these cores. Please note that on Linux the binding 
requires a Linux kernel version of 2.6.16 or greater. It might be even possible to use a kernel with lower version 
number but in that case additional kernel patches have to be applied. The `loadcheck` tool in the utilbin directory 
can be used to check if the hosts capabilities. You can also use the `-sep` in combination with `-cb` of qconf(5) 
command to identify if xxQS_NAMExx is able to recognize the hardware topology.

Possible values for *binding_strategy* are as follows:

        linear:<amount>[:<socket>,<core>]
        striding:<amount>:<n>[:<socket>,<core>]
        explicit:[<socket>,<core>:...]<socket>,<core>

For the binding strategy linear and striding there is an optional socket and core pair attached. This denotes the
mandatory starting point for the first core to bind on.

*linear* means that xxQS_NAMExx tries to bind the job on *amount* successive cores. If *socket* and *core* is 
omitted then xxQS_NAMExx first allocates successive cores on the first empty socket found. Empty means that there 
are no jobs bound to the socket by xxQS_NAMExx. If this is not possible or is not sufficient xxQS_NAMExx tries to 
find (further) cores on the socket with the most unbound cores and so on. If the amount of allocated cores is 
lower than requested cores, no binding is done for the job. If *socket* and *core* is specified then xxQS_NAMExx tries
to find amount of empty cores beginning with this starting point. If this is not possible then binding is not done.

*striding* means that xxQS_NAMExx tries to find cores with a certain offset. It will select *amount* of empty cores 
with an offset of *n* -1 cores in between. Start point for the search algorithm is socket 0 core 0. As soon as 
*amount* cores are found they will be used to do the job binding. If there are not enough empty cores or if correct
offset cannot be achieved then there will be no binding done.

*explicit* binds the specified sockets and cores that are mentioned in the provided socket/core list. 
Each socket/core pair has to be specified only once. If a socket/core pair is already in use by a different job
the whole binding request will be ignored.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect after 
a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then these values will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameters with the
names *binding_strategy*, *binding_type*, *binding_amount*, *binding_step*, *binding_socket*, *binding_core*,
*binding_exp_n*, *binding_exp_socket\<id>*, *binding_exp_core\<id>*.

Please note that the length of the socket/core value list of the explicit binding is reported as *binding_exp_n*. 
*\<id>* will be replaced by the position of the socket/core pair within the explicit 
list (0 \<= *id* \< *binding_exp_n*). The first socket/core pair of the explicit binding will be reported with the 
parameter names *binding_exp_socket0* and *binding_exp_core0*.

Values that do not apply for the specified binding will not be reported to JSV. E.g. *binding_step* will only be
reported for the striding binding and all *binding_exp_** values will be passed to JSV if explicit binding was 
specified. (see -jsv option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -b *y\[es\]* \| *n\[o\]*

Available for `qsub`, `qrsh` only. `qalter` does not allow changing this option. This option cannot be embedded 
in the script file itself.

Gives the user the possibility to indicate explicitly whether *command* should be treated as binary or script. 
If the value of `-b` is 'y', then *command* may be a binary or script. The *command* might not be accessible from 
the submission host. Nothing except the path of the *command* will be transferred from the submission host to the 
execution host. Path aliasing will be applied to the path of *command* before *command* will be executed.

If the value of `-b` is 'n' then *command* needs to be a script, and it will be handled as script. The script file 
has to be accessible by the submission host. It will be transferred to the execution host. `qsub`/`qrsh` will search 
directive prefixes within script.

`qsub` will implicitly use `-b n` whereas `qrsh` will apply the `-b y` option if nothing else is specified.

The value specified with this option will only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is *yes*. The name of 
the parameter will be *b*. The value will be *y* also when then long form *yes* was specified during submission. 
(see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

Please note that submission of *command* as script (`-b n`) can have a significant performance impact, especially for 
short running jobs and big job scripts. Script submission adds a number of operations to the submission process: The 
job script needs to be

* parsed at client side (for special comments)
* transferred from submit client to qmaster
* spooled in qmaster
* transferred to execd at job execution
* spooled in execd
* removed from spooling both in execd and qmaster once the job is done

If job scripts are available on the execution nodes, e.g. via NFS, binary submission can be the better choice.

## -c *occasion_specifier*

Available for `qsub` and `qalter` only.

Defines or redefines whether the job should be checkpointed, and if so, under what circumstances. The specification 
of the checkpointing occasions with this option overwrites the definitions of the *when* parameter in the 
checkpointing environment (see xxqs_name_sxx_ckpt(5)) referenced by the `qsub -ckpt` switch. Possible values for
*occasion_specifier* are

* n	- no checkpoint is performed. 
* s	- checkpoint when batch server is shut down.
* m	- checkpoint at minimum CPU interval.
* x	- checkpoint when job gets suspended.
* \<interval\> - checkpoint in the specified time interval.

The minimum CPU interval is defined in the queue configuration (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) for details). 
\<interval\> has to be specified in the format hh:mm:ss. The maximum of \<interval\> and the queue's minimum CPU
interval is used if \<interval> is specified. This is done to ensure that a machine is not overloaded by 
checkpoints being generated too frequently.

The value specified with this option will be passed to defined JSV instances. The \<interval> will be available as 
parameter with the name *c_interval*. The character sequence specified will be available as parameter with the
name *c_occasion*. Please note that if you change *c_occasion* via JSV then the last setting of *c_interval* will 
be overwritten and vice versa. (see **-jsv** option below or find more information concerning JSV 
in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -ckpt *ckpt_name*

Available for `qsub` and `qalter` only.

Selects the checkpointing environment (see xxqs_name_sxx_checkpoint(5)) to be used for checkpointing the job. Also 
declares the job to be a checkpointing job.

If this option then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name *ckpt*. 
(see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -clear  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, and `qlogin` only.

Causes all elements of the job to be reset to the initial default status prior to applying any modifications 
(if any) appearing in this specific command.

## -cwd  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh` and `qalter` only.

Execute the job from the current working directory. This switch will activate xxQS_NAMExx's path aliasing facility, 
if the corresponding configuration files are present (see xxqs_name_sxx_aliases(5)).

In the case of `qalter`, the previous definition of the current working directory will be overwritten if `qalter` 
is executed from a different directory than the preceding `qsub` or `qalter`.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect after 
a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*cwd*. The value of this parameter will be the absolute path to the current working directory. JSV scripts can 
remove the path from jobs during the verification process by setting the value of this parameter
to an empty string. As a result the job behaves as if `-cwd` was not specified during job submission. (see `-jsv` 
option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -C *prefix_string*

Available for `qsub` and `qrsh` with script submission (`-b n`).

*Prefix_string* defines the prefix that declares a directive in the job's command. The prefix is not a job attribute, 
but affects the behavior of `qsub` and `qrsh`. If *prefix* is a null string, the command will not be scanned for 
embedded directives. The directive prefix consists of two ASCII characters which, when appearing in the first 
two bytes of a script line, indicate that what follows is an xxQS_NAMExx command. The default is "#$". The user 
should be aware that changing the first delimiting character can produce unforeseen side effects. If the script 
file contains anything other than a "#" character in the first byte position of the line, the shell processor for 
the job will reject the line and may exit the job prematurely. If the `-C` option is present in the script file, 
it is ignored.

## -dc *variable*,...  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Removes the given variable(s) from the job's context. Multiple `-ac`, `-dc`, and `-sc` options may be given. 
The order is important.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

The outcome of the evaluation of all `-ac`, `-dc`, and `-sc` options are passed to defined JSV instances as 
parameter with the name **ac**. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV 
in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -dept *department_name*

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Specifies the department to which this job is assigned.

Usually, the department name is used to group users into a department. If a user belongs to exactly one department,
then jobs submitted by this user automatically belong to this department. If a user belongs to more than one
department, then the user can specify the department name with the `-dept` switch of the submit command,
otherwise the job will be automatically assigned to the first found department where the user belongs to.

The assignment of a job to a department is used for scheduling purposes, accounting, and it can define 
visibility of the job. Find more information about departments in xxqs_name_sxx_access\_list(1).

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*dept*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx\_jsv(1)).

## -display *display_specifier*

Available for `qsh` and `qrsh (with command)`.

Directs xterm(1) to use *display_specifier* in order to contact the X server. The *display_specifier* has to contain 
the hostname part of the display name (e.g. myhost:1). Local display names (e.g. :0) cannot be used in grid 
environments. Values set with the `-display` option overwrite settings from the submission environment and from `-v`
command line options.

If this option is specified, then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*display*. This value will also be available in the job environment which might optionally be passed to JSV scripts. 
The variable name will be *DISPLAY*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV 
in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -dl *date_time* 

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Specifies the deadline initiation time in 

    [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]

format (see `-a` option above). The deadline initiation time is the time at which a deadline job has to reach 
top priority to be able to complete within a given deadline. Before the deadline initiation time the priority 
of a deadline job will be raised steadily until it reaches the maximum as configured by the xxQS_NAMExx administrator.

This option is applicable only for users allowed to submit deadline jobs.

If this option or a corresponding value in `qmon` is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV 
instances as parameter with the name `dl`. The format for the date_time value is CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS (see `-jsv` 
option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -e \[\[hostname\]:\]path,...  

Available for *qsub*, *qsh*, *qrsh*, *qlogin* and *qalter* only.

Defines or redefines the path used for the standard error stream of the job. For `qsh`, `qrsh` and `qlogin` only 
the standard error stream of prolog and epilog is redirected. If the *path* constitutes an absolute path name, 
the error-path attribute of the job is set to *path*, including the *hostname*. If the path name is relative, 
xxQS_NAMExx expands *path* either with the current working directory path (if the *-cwd* switch (see above) 
is also specified) or with the home directory path. If *hostname* is present, the standard error stream will be 
placed in the corresponding location only if the job runs on the specified host. If the path contains a ":" without 
a *hostname*, a leading ":" has to be specified.

As default the file name for interactive jobs is */dev/null*. For batch jobs the default file name has the form 
*<job_name>.e<job_id>* and *<job_name>.e<job_id>*. *task_id* for array job tasks (see `-t` option below).

If *path* is a directory, the standard error stream of the job will be put in this directory under the default 
file name. If the pathname contains certain pseudo environment variables, their value will be expanded at runtime 
of the job and will be used to constitute the standard error stream path name. The following pseudo environment
variables are supported currently:

* $HOME - home directory on execution machine
* $USER	- user ID of job owner
* $JOB_ID - current job ID
* $JOB_NAME	- current job name (see -N option)
* $HOSTNAME	- name of the execution host
* $TASK_ID - array job task index number

Alternatively to $HOME the tilde sign "\~" can be used as common in csh(1) or ksh(1). Note, that the "\~" sign also 
works in combination with usernames, so that "\~\<user>" expands to the home directory of \<user>. Using another 
user ID than that of the job owner requires corresponding permissions, of course.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*e*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))
   
## -hard  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Signifies that all `-q` and `-l` resource requirements following in the command line will be hard requirements 
and must be satisfied in full before a job can be scheduled. As xxQS_NAMExx scans the command line and script file 
for xxQS_NAMExx options and parameters it builds a list of resources required by a job.
All such resource requests are considered as absolutely essential for the job to commence. If the `-soft` option 
(see below) is encountered during the scan then all following resources are designated as "soft
requirements" for execution, or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the `-hard` flag is encountered at a 
later stage of the scan, all resource requests following it once again become "essential". The `-hard` and `-soft` 
options in effect act as "toggles" during the scan.

If this option is specified then the corresponding `-q` and `-l` resource requirements will be passed to
defined JSV instances as parameter with the names *\<scope\>\_q\_hard* and *\<scope\>\_l\_hard*. \<scope\> will be 
replaced by the scope of the resource request (e.g *global*, *master* or *slave*).

Find more information in the sections describing *-q*, *-l* and *-scope*. (see *-jsv* option below or find more 
information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -h \| -h {u\|s\|o\|n\|U\|O\|S}...  

Available for `qsub` (only `-h`), `qrsh`, `qalter` and `qresub` (hold state is removed when not set explicitly).

List of holds to place on a job, a task or some tasks of a job.

* *u* denotes a user hold.
* *s* denotes a system hold.
* *o* denotes a operator hold.
* *n* denotes no hold (requires manager privileges).

As long as any hold other than *n* is assigned to the job, the job is not eligible for execution. Holds can 
be released via `qalter` and `qrls`. In case of *qalter* this is supported by the following additional option 
specifiers for the `-h` switch:

* *U* removes a user hold.
* *S* removes a system hold.
* *O* removes a operator hold.

xxQS_NAMExx managers can assign and remove all hold types, xxQS_NAMExx operators can assign and remove user and 
operator holds, and users can only assign or remove user holds.

In the case of *qsub* only user holds can be placed on a job and thus only the first form of the option with the 
`-h` switch alone is allowed. As opposed to this, *qalter* requires the second form described above.

An alternate means to assign hold is provided by the `qhold` facility.

If the job is an array job (see the `-t` option below), all tasks specified via `-t` are affected by the 
`-h` operation simultaneously.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified with `qsub` then the parameter *h* with the value *u* will be
passed to the defined JSV instances indicating that the job will be in user hold after the submission finishes. 
(see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -help  

Prints a listing of all options.

## -hold_jid *wc_job_list*  

Available for `qsub`, `qrsh`, and `qalter` only. See xxqs_name_sxx_types(1). for *wc_job_list* definition.

Defines or redefines the job dependency list of the submitted job. A reference by job name or pattern is only accepted 
if the referenced job is owned by the same user as the referring job. The submitted job is not eligible for execution 
unless all jobs referenced in the comma-separated job id and/or job name list have completed. If any of the referenced
jobs exits with exit code 100, the submitted job will remain ineligible for execution.

With the help of job names or regular pattern one can specify a job dependency on multiple jobs satisfying the regular 
pattern or on all jobs with the requested name. The name dependencies are resolved at submit time and can only be 
changed via qalter. New jobs or name changes of other jobs will not be taken into account.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect after 
a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*hold_jid*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -hold_jid_ad *wc_job_list*  

Available for `qsub`, `qrsh`, and `qalter` only. See xxqs_name_sxx_types(1) for *wc_job_list* definition.

Defines or redefines the job array dependency list of the submitted job. A reference by job name or pattern is only 
accepted if the referenced job is owned by the same user as the referring job. Each sub-task of the submitted job is 
not eligible for execution unless the corresponding sub-tasks of all jobs referenced in the comma-separated job id 
and/or job name list have completed. If any array task of the referenced jobs exits with exit code 100, the dependent 
tasks of the submitted job will remain ineligible for execution.

With the help of job names or regular pattern one can specify a job dependency on multiple jobs satisfying the 
regular pattern or on all jobs with the requested name. The name dependencies are resolved at submit time and can 
only be changed via qalter. New jobs or name changes of other jobs will not be taken into account.

If either the submitted job or any job in *wc_job_list* are not array jobs with the same range of sub-tasks (see `-t` 
option below), the request list will be rejected and the job create or modify operation will error.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect after 
a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*hold_jid_ad*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -i \[\[hostname\]:\]file,...  

Available for `qsub`, and `qalter` only.

Defines or redefines the file used for the standard input stream of the job. If the *file* constitutes an absolute 
filename, the input-path attribute of the job is set to *path*, including the *hostname*. If the path name is 
relative, xxQS_NAMExx expands *path* either with the current working directory path (if the `-cwd` switch (see above) 
is also specified) or with the home directory path. If *hostname* is present, the standard input stream will be placed 
in the corresponding location only if the job runs on the specified host. If the path contains a ":" without a 
*hostname*, a leading ":" has to be specified.

By default, /dev/null is the input stream for the job.

It is possible to use certain pseudo variables, whose values will be expanded at runtime of the job and will be used 
to express the standard input stream as described in the `-e` option for the standard error stream.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect after 
a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*i*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -inherit  

Available only for `qrsh` and `qmake`.

`qrsh` allows the user to start a task in an already scheduled parallel job. The option `-inherit` tells `qrsh` to 
read a job id from the environment variable *JOB_ID* and start the specified command as a task in this job. Please 
note that in this case, the hostname of the host where the command will be executed must precede the command to 
execute; the syntax changes to

    `qrsh -inherit` \[ *other options* \] *hostname command* \[*command_args* \]

Note also, that in combination with `-inherit`, most other command line options will be ignored. Only the 
options `-verbose`, `-v` and `-V` will be interpreted. As a replacement to option `-cwd` please use `-v PWD`.

Usually a task should have the same environment (including the current working directory) as the corresponding job, 
so specifying the option `-V` should be suitable for most applications.

Note: If in your system the qmaster tcp port is not configured as a service, but rather via the environment variable
xxQS_NAME_Sxx_QMASTER_PORT, make sure that this variable is set in the environment when calling `qrsh` or `qmake` with 
the `-inherit` option. If you call `qrsh` or `qmake` with the `-inherit` option from within a job script, export 
xxQS_NAME_Sxx_QMASTER_PORT with the option `-v xxQS_NAME_Sxx_QMASTER_PORT` either as a command argument or an embedded
directive.

This parameter is not available in the JSV context. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning 
JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -j y\[es\]\|n\[o\]  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Specifies whether the standard error stream of the job is merged into the standard output stream. If both the `-j y` 
and the `-e` options are present, xxQS_NAMExx sets but ignores the error-path attribute.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

The value specified with this option will only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is *yes*. The name of 
the parameter will be *j*. The value will be *y* also when then long form *yes* was specified during submission. 
(see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -js job_share  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Defines or redefines the job share of the job relative to other jobs. Job share is an unsigned integer value. 
The default job share value for jobs is 0.

The job share influences the Share Tree Policy and the Functional Policy. It has no effect on the Urgency and 
Override Policies (see xxqs_name_sxx_share_tree(5) and xxqs_name_sxx_sched_conf(5)).

In case of the Share Tree Policy, users can distribute the tickets to which they are currently entitled among their 
jobs using different shares assigned via `-js`. If all jobs have the same job share value, the tickets are distributed 
evenly. Otherwise, jobs receive tickets relative to the different job shares. Job shares are treated like an
additional level in the share tree in the latter case.

In connection with the Functional Policy, the job share can be used to weight jobs within the functional job category. 
Tickets are distributed relative to any uneven job share distribution treated as a virtual share distribution level 
underneath the functional job category.

If both the Share Tree and the Functional Policy are active, the job shares will have an effect in both policies, and 
the tickets independently derived in each of them are added to the total number of tickets for each job.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*js*. (see `-jsv` option below or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -jsv jsv_url  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh` and `qlogin` only.

Defines a client JSV instance which will be executed to verify the job specification before the job is sent to qmaster.

In contrast to other options this switch will not be overwritten if it is also used in sge_request files. Instead,
all specified JSV instances will be executed to verify the job to be submitted.

The JSV instance which is directly passed with the command-line of a client is executed as first to verify the job 
specification. After that the JSV instance which might have been defined in various sge_request files will be 
triggered to check the job. Find more details in man page xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1) and xxqs_name_sxx_request(5).

The syntax of the *jsv_url* is specified in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

## -l *resource*=*value*, ...  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin*` and `qalter` only.

Launch the job in a xxQS_NAMExx queue meeting the given resource request list. In case of `qalter` the previous 
definition is replaced by the specified one.

xxqs_name_sxx_complex(5) describes how a list of available resources and their associated valid value specifiers
can be obtained.

There may be multiple `-l` switches in a single command. You may request multiple `-l` options to be soft or hard 
both in the same command line. In case of a serial job multiple `-l` switches refine the definition for the sought 
queue.

With parallel jobs (see `-pe` option above) the `-l` option can be applied to the whole job, to the master tasks 
or to the slave tasks only by using the `-scope` option.

`qalter` allows changing the value of this option even while the job is running, but only if the initial list of 
resources does not contain a resource that is marked as consumable. However, the modification will only be 
effective after a restart or migration of the job.

If this option is specified then these hard and soft resource requirements will be passed to defined JSV instances 
as parameter with the names *\<scope>\_l_hard* and *\<scope>\_l_hard*. \<scope> will be replaced by the scope of 
the resource request (e.g. *global*, *master* or *slave*). If regular expressions will be used for resource requests, 
then these expressions will be passed to JSV as they are. Also shortcut names for resources will not be expanded.

For compatibility with older versions and flavours of Grid Engine, the parameters names *l_hard* and *l_soft* 
can be used instead of *global_l_hard* and *global_l_soft*. Please note that the JSV behaviour is undefined 
if the use of old and new names is mixed within one JSV script.

Find more information in the sections describing `-hard`, `-soft`, `-q` and `-scope`. (see `-jsv` option below or 
find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -m b\|e\|a\|s\|n,...  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Defines or redefines under which circumstances mail is to be sent to the job owner or to the users defined with the 
`-M` option described below. The option arguments have the following meaning:

* *b*     Mail is sent at the beginning of the job. 
* *e*     Mail is sent at the end of the job.
* *a*     Mail is sent when the job is aborted or rescheduled.
* *s*     Mail is sent when the job is suspended.
* *n*     No mail is sent.

Currently, no mail is sent when a job is suspended.

`qalter` allows changing the *b*, *e*, and *a* option arguments even while the job executes. The modification of the 
*b* option argument will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*m*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in

## -M user\[@host\],...  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Defines or redefines the list of users to which the server that executes the job has to send mail, if the server 
sends mail about the job. Default is the job owner at the originating host.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*M*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -masterq *wc_queue_list*

NOTE: This option is deprecated. Use the `-scope master -q we_queue_list` instead, see `-scope` option below.

Available for `qsub`, `qrsh`, `qsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter`. Only meaningful for parallel jobs, i.e. together 
with the `-pe` option.

Defines or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains and queue instances which may be used to become the 
so-called *master queue* of a parallel job. A more detailed description of *wc_queue_list* can be found in 
xxqs_name_sxx_types(1). The *master queue* is defined as the queue where the parallel job is started. 
The other queues to which the parallel job spawns tasks are called *slave queues*. A parallel job only
has one *master queue*.

This parameter has all the properties of a resource request and will be merged with requirements derived from the 
`-l` option described above.

`Qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified the hard resource requirement will be passed to defined JSV instances as
parameter with the name *master_q_hard*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in 
xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

For compatibility with older versions and flavours of Grid Engine, the parameters name *masterq* can be used 
instead of *master_q_hard*. Please note that the JSV behaviour is undefined if the use of the old and new names 
is mixed within one JSV script

## -notify  

Available for `qsub`, `qrsh` (with command) and `qalter` only.

This flag, when set causes xxQS_NAMExx to send "warning" signals to a running job prior to sending the signals 
themselves. If a SIGSTOP is pending, the job will receive a SIGUSR1 several seconds before the SIGSTOP. If a SIGKILL 
is pending, the job will receive a SIGUSR2 several seconds before the SIGKILL. This option provides the running job, 
before receiving the SIGSTOP or SIGKILL, a configured time interval to do e.g. cleanup operations. The amount of time 
delay is controlled by the *notify* parameter in each queue configuration (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)).

Note that the Linux operating system "misused" the user signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 in some early Posix thread 
implementations. You might not want to use the `-notify` option if you are running multithreaded applications in 
your jobs under Linux, particularly on 2.0 or earlier kernels.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

Only if this option is used the parameter named *notify* with the value *y* will be passed to defined JSV instances. 
(see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

# -now y\[es\]\|n\[o\]  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qlogin` and `qrsh`.

`-now y` tries to start the job immediately or not at all. The command returns 0 on success, or 1 on failure (also 
if the job could not be scheduled immediately). For array jobs submitted with the `-now` option, if all tasks cannot 
be immediately scheduled, no tasks are scheduled.

Jobs submitted with `-now y` option, can ONLY run on INTERACTIVE queues. `-now y` is default for `qsh`, `qlogin` and `qrsh`

With the `-now n` option, the job will be put into the pending queue if it cannot be executed immediately. `-now n` is 
default for `qsub`.

The value specified with this option will only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is *yes*. The name 
of the parameter will be *now*. The value will be *y* also when then long form *yes* was specified during
submission. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -N name 

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

The name of the job. The name should follow the *name* definition in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1). Invalid job names will 
be denied at submit time.

If the `-N` option is not present, xxQS_NAMExx assigns the name of the job script to the job after any directory 
pathname has been removed from the script-name. If the script is read from standard input, the job name
defaults to STDIN.

In the case of `qsh` or `qlogin` with the `-N` option is absent, the string *INTERACT* is assigned to the job.

In the case of `qrsh` if the `-N` option is absent, the resulting job name is determined from the `qrsh` command 
line by using the argument string up to the first occurrence of a semicolon or whitespace and removing the 
directory pathname.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

The value specified with this option will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name `N`. 
(see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -noshell  

Available only for `qrsh` with a command line.

Do not start the command line given to `qrsh` in a user's login shell, i.e. execute it without the wrapping shell.

This option can be used to speed up execution as some overhead, like the shell startup and sourcing the shell 
resource files, is avoided.

This option can only be used if no shell-specific command line parsing is required. If the command line contains 
shell syntax like environment variable substitution or (back) quoting, a shell must be started. In this case, either 
do not use the *-noshell* option or include the shell call in the command line.

Example:

    qrsh echo '$HOSTNAME'  

Alternative call with the `-noshell` option  

    qrsh -noshell /bin/tcsh -f -c 'echo $HOSTNAME'

## -nostdin 

Available only for `qrsh`.

Suppress the input stream STDIN - `qrsh` will pass the option -n to the rsh(1) command. This is especially useful, 
if multiple tasks are executed in parallel using `qrsh`, e.g. in a qmake(1) process - it would be undefined, which 
process would get the input.

## -o \[\[hostname\]:\]path,...  
Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

The path used for the standard output stream of the job. The *path* is handled as described in the `-e` option for 
the standard error stream.

By default, the file name for standard output has the form 

    <job_name>.*o*<job_id> 

and 

    <job_name>.*o*<job_id>.<task_id> 

for array job tasks (see `-t` option below).

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*o*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -ot *override_tickets*

Available for `qalter` only.

Changes the number of override tickets for the specified job. Requires manager/operator privileges.

## -P *project_name*

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Specifies the project to which this job is assigned. The administrator needs to give permission to individual users 
to submit jobs to a specific project. (see `-aprj` option to qconf(1)).

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*ot*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1)).

## -p priority  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Defines or redefines the priority of the job relative to other jobs. Priority is an integer in the range -1023 to 1024. 
The default priority value for jobs is 0.

Users may only decrease the priority of their jobs. xxQS_NAMExx managers and administrators may also increase the 
priority associated with jobs. If a pending job has higher priority, it is earlier eligible for being
dispatched by the xxQS_NAMExx scheduler.

If this option is specified and the priority is not 0 then this value will be passed to defined JSV
instances as parameter with the name *p*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in 
xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -pe *parallel_environment* n\[-\[m\]\]\|\[-\]m,...  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Parallel programming environment (PE) to instantiate. For more detail about PEs, please see the xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect after 
a restart or migration of the job, however.

If this option is specified then the parameters *pe_name*, *pe_min* and *pe_max* will be passed to configured JSV 
instances where *pe_name* will be the name of the parallel environment and the values *pe_min* and *pe_max* 
represent the values *n* and *m* which have been provided with the `-pe` option. A missing specification of *m* will 
be expanded as value 9999999 in JSV scripts, and it represents the value infinity. (see `-jsv` option above
or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -pty y\[es\]\|n\[o\] 

Available for `qrsh` and `qlogin` only.

`-pty yes` enforces the job to be started in a pseudo terminal (pty). If no pty is available, the job start fails. 
`-pty no` enforces the job to be started without a pty. By default, `qrsh` without a command and `qlogin` start the 
job in a pty, `qrsh` with a command starts the job without a pty.

This parameter is not available in the JSV context. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV 
in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -q *wc_queue_list*  

Available for `qsub`, `qrsh`, `qsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter`.

Defines or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains or queue instances which may be used to execute 
this job. Please find a description of *wc_queue_list* in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1). This parameter
has all the properties of a resource request and will be merged with requirements derived from the `-l` option
described above.

With parallel jobs (see `-pe` option above) the `-q` option can be applied to the whole job, to the master queue 
or to the slave queues by using the `-scope` option.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.
If this option is specified then these hard and soft queue requests will be passed to defined JSV instances
as parameter with the names *\<scope>\_q_hard* and *\<scope>\_q_soft*. \<scope> will be replaced by the scope of
the resource request (e.g. *global*, *master* or *slave*).

For compatibility with older versions and flavours of Grid Engine, the parameters names *q_hard*, *q_soft*
and *masterq* can be used instead of *global_q_hard*, *global_q_soft* and *master_q_hard*. Please note that the
JSV behaviour is undefined if the use of old and new names is mixed within one JSV script.

Find more information in the sections describing `-hard`, `-soft`, `-l` and `-scope`. (see `-jsv` option below or
find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -R y\[es\]\|n\[o\]  

Available for `qsub`, `qrsh`, `qsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter`.

Indicates whether a reservation for this job should be done. Reservation is never done for immediate jobs, i.e. 
jobs submitted using the `-now yes` option. Please note that regardless of the reservation request, job reservation 
might be disabled using max_reservation in xxqs_namme_sxx_sched_conf(5) and might be limited only to a certain 
number of high priority jobs.

By default, jobs are submitted with the `-R n` option.

The value specified with this option will only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is *yes*. The name 
of the parameter will be *R*. The value will be *y* also when then long form *yes* was specified during
submission. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -r y\[es\]\|n\[o\]  

Available for `qsub` and `qalter` only.

Identifies the ability of a job to be rerun or not. If the value of `-r` is *yes*, the job will be rerun if the job 
was aborted without leaving a consistent exit state. (This is typically the case if the node on which the job is 
running crashes). If `-r` is *no*, the job will not be rerun under any circumstances.
Interactive jobs submitted with `qsh`, `qrsh` or `qlogin` are not re-runnable.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

The value specified with this option will only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is *yes*. The name 
of the parameter will be *r*. The value will be *y* also when then long form *yes* was specified during
submission. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -sc variable\[=value\],...  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Sets the given name/value pairs as the job's context. Value may be omitted. xxQS_NAMExx replaces the job's 
previously defined context with the one given as the argument. Multiple `-ac`, `-dc`, and `-sc` options may
be given. The order is important.

Contexts provide a way to dynamically attach and remove meta-information to and from a job. The context variables 
are not passed to the job's execution context in its environment.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes.

The outcome of the evaluation of all `-ac`, `-dc`, and `-sc` options is passed to defined JSV** instances as
parameter with the name *ac*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -scope *global* \| *master* \| *slave*

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Defines the scope of the `-l` and `-q` options when submitting parallel jobs (see option `-pe` above).  
The default scope is the *global* scope. The global scope applies the `-l` and `-q` options to the whole job 
and all its tasks. The master scope applies the `-l` and `-q` only to the master task of the job (usually 
the job script). The slave scope applies the `-l` and `-q` options only to the slave tasks of the job.

Example:
```
qsub -pe mpi 16 -l h_rt=3600 -scope master -q io.q -l memory=1G \
-scope slave -q compute.q -l memory=4G,gpu=1 my_mpi_job.sh
```

We submit a 16 times parallel job using the mpi parallel environment. The job runtime is (globally) limited to 
1 hour. The master task shall run in the io.q queue with a memory limit of 1G. The slave tasks shall run in 
the compute.q queue with a memory limit of 4G and one GPU.

Using the `-scope` switch has a few constraints:
* It cannot be used with sequential jobs.
* Soft queue (`-q`) or resource requests (`-l`) are only allowed in the *global* scope.
* Resource requests (`-l` option) for a specific variable can be done either in the *global* scope, 
  or in *master* and *slave* scope.
* Per host resource requests on a specific variable can only be done in
  one scope, either in *global*, in *master* or in *slave* scope.

`Qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in 
effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

The request `-scope master -q wc_queue_list` replaces the deprecated `-masterq wc_queue_list` option.

If this option is specified then these hard and soft resource and queue requests will be passed to defined 
JSV instances as parameter of the form *\<scope>\_\<l-or-q>\_\<hard-or-soft>*. \<scope> will be replaced by 
the scope of the specified scope (e.g. *global*, *master* or *slave*).

The arguments of the job submission from the example above will be passed to JSV instances as follows: 
*global_l_hard* will show the runtime (`-l h_rt=3600`), *master_q_hard* and *master_l_hard* will allow to 
access the queue and memory request for the master task (`-scope master -q io.q -l memory=1G`) and 
*slave_q_hard* and *slave_l_hard* will provide the queue and memory request for the slave tasks 
(`-scope slave -q compute.q -l memory=4G,gpu=1`).

Find more information in the sections describing `-hard`, `-soft`, `-l` and `-q`. (see `-jsv` option below or
find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -shell y\[es\]\|n\[o\]  
Available only for `qsub`.

`-shell n` causes qsub to execute the command line directly, as if by exec(2). No command shell will be executed 
for the job. This option only applies when `-b y` is also used. Without `-b y`, `-shell n` has no effect.

This option can be used to speed up execution as some overhead, like the shell startup and sourcing the shell 
resource files is avoided.

This option can only be used if no shell-specific command line parsing is required. If the command line contains 
shell syntax, like environment variable substitution or (back) quoting, a shell must be started. In this case either 
do not use the `-shell n` option or execute the shell as the command line and pass the path to the executable as 
a parameter.

If a job executed with the `-shell n` option fails due to a user error, such as an invalid path to the executable, 
the job will enter the error state.

`-shell y` cancels the effect of a previous `-shell n`. Otherwise, it has no effect.

See `-b` and `-noshell` for more information.

The value specified with this option will only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is *yes*. The name of 
the parameter will be shell. The value will be *y* also when then long form *yes* was specified during
submission. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -soft 

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter` only.

Signifies that all resource requirements following in the command line will be soft requirements and are to be 
filled on an "as available" basis.  
As xxQS_NAMExx scans the command line and script file for xxQS_NAMExx options and parameters, it builds a list 
of resources required by the job. All such resource requests are considered as absolutely essential for the 
job to commence. If the `-soft` option is encountered during the scan then all following resources are designated 
as "soft requirements" for execution, or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the `-hard` flag (see above) is 
encountered at a later stage of the scan, all resource requests following it once again become "essential".
The `-hard` and `-soft` options in effect act as "toggles" during the scan.

If this option is specified then the corresponding `-q` and `-l` resource requirements will be passed to
defined JSV instances as parameter with the names *global_q_soft* and *global_l_soft*. 

Find more information in the sections describing *-q*, *-l* and *-scope*. (see *-jsv* option below or find more
information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -sync r|x|n (or y\[es\]\|n\[o\])  

Available for `qsub`.

The `-sync` option *yes* and *no* are deprecated. Use *r*, *x* and *n* instead. `qsub -sync yes` is equivalent to
`qsub -sync x` and `qsub -sync no` is equivalent to `qsub -sync n`.

`-sync` causes `qsub` to wait for one or multiple job states to be reached before exiting. The option argument
specifies the job state(s) to wait for. 

If `-sync r` is used `qsub` will wait for the job to leave the *qw* state before it terminates. 
If `-sync r` is used in conjunction with `-t n[-m[:s]]`, `qsub` will wait for at least one task of the array job to 
leave the queues-waiting state. A task is considered to leave the queues-waiting state if it enters the running 
state or if it is deleted before start.

`-sync x` causes `qsub` to wait for the job to complete before exiting. If the job completes successfully, 
The exit code of `qsub` will be that of the completed job. If the job fails to complete successfully,
`qsub` will print out an error message indicating why the job failed and will have an exit code of 1. If `qsub` 
is interrupted, e.g. with CTRL-C, before the job completes, the job will be canceled.

If `-sync x` is used in conjunction with `-t n[-m[:s]]`, `qsub` will wait for all the job's tasks to complete
before exiting. If all the job's tasks complete successfully, The exit code ob `qsub` will be that of the first
completed job tasks with a non-zero exit code, or 0 if all job tasks exited with an exit code of 0. If any of the
job's tasks fail to complete successfully, `qsub` will print out an error message indicating why the job task(s)
failed and will have an exit code of 1. If `qsub` is interrupted, e.g. with CTRL-C, before the job completes,
all the job's tasks will be canceled.

With the `-sync n` option (default if nothing else is specified), `qsub` will exit with an exit code of 0 as soon as 
the job is submitted successfully. 

If `-sync rx` is used, `qsub` will behave as though only `-sync r` were given until the job has been started,
after which time `qsub` will behave as though only `-sync x` were given. If `-sync ...` is used in conjunction with 
`-now y`, `qsub` will behave as though only `-now y` were given until the job has been successfully scheduled, 
after which time `qsub` will behave as though only `-sync ...` were given.  

Information that this switch was specified during submission is not available in the JSV context. (see `-jsv` option 
above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -S \[\[hostname\]:\]pathname,...  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh` and `qalter`.

Specifies the interpreting shell for the job. Only one *pathname* component without a host specifier is valid and 
only one path name for a given host is allowed. Shell paths with host assignments define the interpreting shell 
for the job if the host is the execution host. The shell path without host specification is used if the execution host
matches none of the hosts in the list.

Furthermore, the pathname can be constructed with pseudo environment variables as described for the `-e` option above.

In the case of `qsh` the specified shell path is used to execute the corresponding command interpreter in the 
xterm(1) (via its `-e` option) started on behalf of the interactive job. `qalter` allows changing this option 
even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the 
job, however.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the
name *S*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -t n\[-m\[:s\]\]  

Available for `qsub` and `qalter` only.

Submits a so-called Array Job, i.e. an array of identical tasks being differentiated only by an index number 
and being treated by xxQS_NAMExx almost like a series of jobs. The option argument to `-t` specifies the number 
of array job tasks and the index number which will be associated with the tasks. The index numbers will be exported 
to the job tasks via the environment variable xxQS_NAME_Sxx_TASK_ID. The option arguments n, m and s will be 
available through the environment variables xxQS_NAME_Sxx_TASK_FIRST, xxQS_NAME_Sxx_TASK_LAST and
xxQS_NAME_Sxx_TASK_STEPSIZE.

Following restrictions apply to the values n and m:

    1 <= n <= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
    1 <= m <= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
    n <= m

*max_aj_tasks* is defined in the cluster configuration (see xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5))

The task id range specified in the option argument may be a single number, a simple range of the form *n-m* or a 
range with a step size. Hence, the task id range specified by 2-10:2 would result in the task id indexes 2, 4, 6, 8, 
and 10, for a total of 5 identical tasks, each with the environment variable xxQS_NAME_Sxx_TASK_ID containing 
one of the 5 index numbers.

All array job tasks inherit the same resource requests and attribute definitions as specified in the `qsub` or 
`qalter` command line, except for the `-t` option. The tasks are scheduled independently and, provided enough 
resources exist, concurrently, very much like separate jobs. However, an array job or a sub-array there of can be 
accessed as a single unit by commands like `qmod` or `qdel`. See the corresponding manual pages for further detail.

Array jobs are commonly used to execute the same type of operation on varying input data sets correlated with the 
task index number. The number of tasks in a array job is unlimited.

STDOUT and STDERR of array job tasks will be written into different files with the default location

    <jobname>.['e'|'o']<job_id>'.'<task_id>

In order to change this default, the `-e` and `-o` options (see above) can be used together with the pseudo 
environment variables \$HOME, \$USER, \$JOB_ID, \$JOB_NAME, \$HOSTNAME, and \$xxQS_NAME_Sxx_TASK_ID.

Note, that you can use the output redirection to divert the output of all tasks into the same file, but the 
result of this is undefined.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameters with
the name *t_min*, *t_max* and *t_step* (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in
xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -tc *max_running_tasks*

Available for `qsub` and `qalter` only.

Can be used in conjunction with array jobs (see `-t` option) to set a self-imposed limit on the maximum number 
of concurrently running tasks per job.

If this option is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
*tc*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -terse 

Available for `qsub` only.

`-terse` causes the `qsub` to display only the job-id of the job being submitted rather than the regular 
"Your job ..." string. In case of an error the error is reported on stderr as usual. This can be helpful for 
scripts which need to parse `qsub` output to get the job-id.

Information that this switch was specified during submission is not available in the JSV context. (see `-jsv` 
option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -u username,...  

Available for `qalter` only. Changes are only made on those jobs which were submitted by users specified in the 
list of usernames. For manager, it is possible to use the `qalter -u *` command to modify all jobs of all users.

If you use the `-u switch it is not permitted to specify an additional *wc_job_range_list*.

## -v variable\[=value\],...  
Available for `qsub`, `qrsh`, `qlogin`, `qsh`, and `qalter`.

Defines or redefines the environment variables to be exported to the execution context of the job. If the `-v` 
option is present xxQS_NAMExx will add the environment variables defined as arguments to the switch and, optionally, 
values of specified variables, to the execution context of the job.

In case of `qlogin` and `qrsh` (without a command) the `-v` option can only be specified when the underlying
transport mechanism is configured as `builtin`.
See also xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5), attributes `*_command` and `*_daemon` for more information on the transport mechanism.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

All environment variables specified with `-v`, `-V` or the *DISPLAY* variable provided with `-display` will be 
exported to the defined JSV instances only optionally when this is requested explicitly during the job submission 
verification. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -verbose  
Available only for `qrsh` and `qmake`.

Unlike `qsh` and `qlogin`, `qrsh` does not output any informational messages while establishing the session, 
compliant with the standard rsh(1) and rlogin(1) system calls. If the option `-verbose` is set, `qrsh` behaves 
like the `qsh` and `qlogin` commands, printing information about the process of establishing the rsh(1) or 
rlogin(1) session.

## -verify  
Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter`.

Instead of submitting a job, prints detailed information about the would-be job as though `qstat` -j were used, 
including the effects of command-line parameters and the external environment.

## -V  
Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin`, and `qalter`.

Specifies that all environment variables active within the `qsub` utility be exported to the context of the job.

In case of `qlogin` and `qrsh` (without a command) the `-v` option can only be specified when the underlying
transport mechanism is configured as `builtin`.
See also xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5), attributes `*_command` and `*_daemon` for more information on the transport mechanism.

All environment variables specified with `-v`, `-V` or the *DISPLAY* variable provided with `-display` will be 
exported to the defined JSV instances only optionally when this is requested explicitly during the job submission 
verification. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## -w e\|w\|n\|p\|v 

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh`, `qlogin` and `qalter`.

Specifies a validation level applied to the job to be submitted (`qsub`, `qlogin`, and `qsh`) or the specified 
queued job (`qalter`). The information displayed indicates whether the job can possibly be scheduled assuming an 
empty system with no other jobs. Resource requests exceeding the configured maximal thresholds or requesting 
unavailable resource attributes are possible causes for jobs to fail this validation.

The specifiers *e*, *w*, *n* and *v* define the following validation modes:

* *e*	error - jobs with invalid requests will be rejected.
* *w*	warning - only a warning will be displayed for invalid requests.
* *n*	none - switches off validation; the default for `qsub`, `qalter`, `qrsh`, `qsh` and `qlogin`.
* *p*	poke - does not submit the job but prints a validation report based on a cluster as is with all resource utilization's in place. 
* *v*	verify - does not submit the job but prints a validation report based on an empty cluster.

Note, that the necessary checks are performance consuming and hence the checking is switched off by default. It 
should also be noted that load values are not taken into account with the verification since they are assumed to be 
too volatile. To cause -w e verification to be passed at submission time, it is possible to specify non-volatile values
(non-consumables) or maximum values (consumables) in complex_values.

## -wd *working_dir*  

Available for `qsub`, `qsh`, `qrsh` and `qalter` only.

Execute the job from the directory specified in working_dir. This switch will activate xxQS_NAMExx's path aliasing 
facility, if the corresponding configuration files are present (see xxqs_name_sxx_aliases(5)).

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however. 

The parameter value will be available in defined JSV instances as parameter with the name *cwd* (see `-cwd` 
switch above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## command  
Available for `qsub` and `qrsh` only.

The job's script file or binary. If not present or if the operand is the single-character string '-', `qsub` reads 
the script from standard input.

The command will be available in defined JSV instances as parameter with the name *CMDNAME* (see `-jsv` option 
above or find more information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## command_args  
Available for `qsub`, `qrsh` and `qalter` only.

Arguments to the job. Not valid if the script is entered from standard input.

`qalter` allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect 
after a restart or migration of the job, however.

The number of command arguments is provided to configured JSV instances as parameter with the name *CMDARGS*. 
Also the argument values can by accessed. Argument names have the format *CMDARG\<number>* where \<number> is 
a integer between 0 and CMDARGS - 1. (see `-jsv` option above or find more information concerning JSV 
in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

## xterm_args  
Available for `qsh` only.

Arguments to the xterm(1) executable, as defined in the configuration. For details, refer to xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5)).

Information concerning *xterm_args* will be available in JSV context as parameters with the name *CMDARGS* and 
*CMDARG\<number>*. Find more information above in section *command_args*. (see `-jsv` option above or find more 
information concerning JSV in xxqs_name_sxx_jsv(1))

# ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

For a complete list of common environment variables used by all xxQS_NAMExx commands, see xxqs_name_sxx_intro(1).

## DISPLAY  
For `qsh` jobs the *DISPLAY* has to be specified at job submission. If the *DISPLAY* is not set by using the 
`-display` or the `-v` switch, the contents of the DISPLAY environment variable are used as default.

In addition to those environment variables specified to be exported to the job via the `-v` or the `-V` option
(see above) `qsub`, `qsh`, and `qlogin` add the following variables with the indicated values to the variable list:

## SGE\_O\_HOME  
the home directory of the submitting client.

## SGE\_O\_HOST  
the name of the host on which the submitting client is running.

## SGE\_O\_LOGNAME  
the *LOGNAME* of the submitting client.

xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) binary.

## SGE_BINDING  
This variable contains the selected operating system internal processor numbers. They might be more than selected 
cores in presence of SMT or CMT because each core could be represented by multiple processor identifiers. The processor 
numbers are space separated.

## SGE_CKPT_ENV  
Specifies the checkpointing environment (as selected with the `-ckpt` option) under which a checkpointing job 
executes. Only set for checkpointing jobs.

## SGE_CKPT_DIR  
Only set for checkpointing jobs. Contains path *ckpt_dir* (see xxqs_name_sxx_checkpoint(5) ) of the checkpoint interface.

## SGE_CWD_PATH  
Specifies the current working directory where the job was started.

## SGE_STDERR_PATH  
the pathname of the file to which the standard error stream of the job is diverted. Commonly used for enhancing the 
output with error messages from prolog, epilog, parallel environment start/stop or checkpointing scripts.

## SGE_STDOUT_PATH  
the pathname of the file to which the standard output stream of the job is diverted. Commonly used for enhancing 
the output with messages from prolog, epilog, parallel environment start/stop or checkpointing scripts.

## SGE_STDIN_PATH  
the pathname of the file from which the standard input stream of the job is taken. This variable might be used in 
combination with xxQS_NAME_Sxx_O_HOST in prolog/epilog scripts to transfer the input file from the submit host to 
the execution host.

## SGE_JOB_SPOOL_DIR  
The directory used by xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd(8) to store job related data during job execution. This directory is 
owned by root or by a xxQS_NAMExx administrative account and commonly is not open for read or write access to regular 
users.

## SGE_TASK_ID  
The index number of the current array job task (see `-t option` above). This is a unique number in each array job 
and can be used to reference different input data records, for example. This environment variable is set to 
"undefined" for non-array jobs. It is possible to change the predefined value of this variable with `-v` or `-V` (see
options above).

## SGE_TASK_FIRST  
The index number of the first array job task (see `-t` option above). It is possible to change the predefined 
value of this variable with `-v` or `-V` (see options above).

## SGE_TASK_LAST

The user's home directory.

## HOSTNAME  
The hostname of the node on which the job is running.

## JOB_ID  
A unique identifier assigned by the xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8) when the job was submitted. The job ID is a decimal integer in the range 1 to 2147483647 (INT32_MAX).

## JOB_NAME  
The job name. For batch jobs or jobs submitted by `qrsh` with a command, the job name is built as basename of 
the `qsub` script filename resp. the `qrsh` command. For interactive jobs it is set to *INTERACTIVE* for `qsh` 
jobs, *QLOGIN* for `qlogin` jobs and *QRLOGIN* for `qrsh` jobs without a command.

This default may be overwritten by the `-N.` option.

## JOB_SCRIPT  
The path to the job script which is executed. The value can not be overwritten by the `-v` or `-V` option.

## LOGNAME  
The user's login name.

## NHOSTS  
The number of hosts in use by a parallel job.

## NQUEUES  
The number of queues allocated for the job (always 1 for serial jobs).

## NSLOTS  
The number of queue slots in use by a parallel job.

## PATH  
A default shell search path of:  

/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin

## SGE_BINARY_PATH  
The path where the xxQS_NAMExx binaries are installed. The value is the concatenation of the cluster configuration 
value *binary_path* and the architecture name *$SGE_ARCH* environment variable.

## PE  
The parallel environment under which the job executes (for parallel jobs only).

## PE_HOSTFILE  
The path of a file containing the definition of the virtual parallel machine assigned to a parallel job by 
xxQS_NAMExx. See the description of the *$pe_hostfile* parameter in xxqs_name_sxx_pe(5) for details on the format 
of this file. The environment variable is only available for parallel jobs.

## SGE_PE_TASK_ID
A task of a tightly integrated parallel job is uniquely identified by the JOB_ID, the SGE_TASK_ID and the SGE_PE_TASK_ID.  
The SGE_PE_TASK_ID consists of a running number, a dot (`.`) and the host name, e.g. `4.host-123`.

## QUEUE  
The name of the cluster queue in which the job is running.

## REQUEST  
Available for batch jobs only.

The request name of a job as specified with the `-N` switch (see above) or taken as the name of the job script file.

## RESTARTED  
This variable is set to 1 if a job was restarted either after a system crash or after a migration in case of a 
checkpointing job. The variable has the value 0 otherwise.

## SHELL  
The user's login shell. Note: This is not necessarily the shell in use for the job.

## TMPDIR  
The absolute path to the job's temporary working directory.

## TMP  
The same as TMPDIR; provided for compatibility with NQS.

## TZ  
The time zone variable imported from xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) if set.

## USER  
The user's login name.

## SGE_JSV_TIMEOUT  
If the response time of the client JSV is greater than this timeout value, then the JSV will attempt to be 
re-started. The default value is 10 seconds, and this value must be greater than 0. If the timeout has been 
reached, the JSV will only try to re-start once, if the timeout is reached again an error will occur.

# RESTRICTIONS

There is no controlling terminal for batch jobs under xxQS_NAMExx, and any tests or actions on a controlling 
terminal will fail. If these operations are in your login file (e.g .login or .cshrc), they may cause your job to
abort.

Insert the following test before any commands that are not pertinent to batch jobs in your .login:

    if ( $?JOB_NAME) then
    echo "xxQS_NAMExx spooled job"
    exit 0
    endif

Don't forget to set your shell's search path in your shell start-up
before this code.

# EXIT STATUS

The following exit values are returned:

* *0*   Operation was executed successfully.
* *1*   It was not possible to register a new job according to the configured *max_u\_jobs* or *max_jobs* limit. Additional information may be found in sge_conf(5)
* \>0   Error occurred.
