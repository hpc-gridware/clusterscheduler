# NAME

xxqs_name_sxx_diagnostics - xxQS_NAMExx diagnostics documentation

# DESCRIPTION

This document describes how to collect diagnostic information for xxQS_NAMExx installations.
It is intended to be used by system administrators and support personnel to gather relevant information about the xxQS_NAMExx installation and its current state.

## Error Codes reported in the failed state of jobs

The `failed` attribute of both `qstat -j <job_id>` and `qacct -j <job_id>` commands can contain error codes that
indicate the reason for a job failure.

Depending on the error code the job or the queue instance may be set into error state.

The reason for a queue error state can be queried via `qstat -explain E`.  
The error state can be cleared via `qmod -cq <queue_name>`.

The reason for a job error state can be queried via `qstat -j <job_id>`.   
The error state can be cleared via `qmod -cj <job_id>`.

The following table lists the error codes and their meaning:

|  Code | Name / Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

More details about errors reported by `sge_execd` can be found in the `sge_execd` messages file.   
For errors reported by `sge_shepherd` please check the `sge_shepherd` trace file or the error mail (if requested at job submission) or administrator mail (if configured in the global configuration).


# ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

For a complete list of common environment variables used by all xxQS_NAMExx commands, see xxqs_name_sxx_intro(1).

# FILES

The `sge_shepherd` trace file is located in `<sge_shepherd_spool_dir>/active_jobs/<job_id>.<array_task_id>/trace` (where `<array_task_id>` is `1` for non-array jobs).   
Set the `execd_params` attribute `KEEP_ACTIVE` to keep the active job directories after job termination. See xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5) for details.

The `sge_execd` messages file is located in the `sge_execd` spool directory.
