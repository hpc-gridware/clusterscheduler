# NAME

`qconf` - xxQS_NAMExx command to customise configuration objects and get or change the state of cluster components.  

# SYNTAX

`qconf` *\<options\>*

# DESCRIPTION

`Qconf` allows the system administrator to add, delete, and modify the current xxQS_NAMExx configuration, including 
queue management, host management, complex management and user management. `Qconf` also allows you to examine the 
current queue configuration for existing queues.

Some *\<options\>* of `qconf` start up an editor indicated by the environment variable *EDITOR*. If such a variable 
is not set then as default the vi(1) editor will be started.

`Qconf` allows the use of the backslash, '\\', character at the end of a line to indicate that the next line is a 
continuation of the current line. When displaying settings, such as the output of one of the `-s...` options, `qconf` 
will break up long lines (lines greater than 80 characters) into smaller lines using backslash line continuation 
where possible. Lines will only be broken up at commas or whitespace. This feature can be disabled by setting the 
*SGE_SINGLE_LINE* environment variable.

Operations of `qconf` (add, modify or delete) will not have an effect on ongoing decisions of the *scheduler* 
component in xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). Changes will be effective with the next scheduling cycle. The same applies
for execution, configuration and queue settings which will be in effect for the next job that is
started on/in the corresponding object. 

Unless denoted otherwise, `qconf` *\<options\>* and the corresponding operations are available to all users
with a valid account but some of them require root/manager privileges. 

# OPTIONS

## -aattr *obj_spec* *attr_name* *val* *obj_instance*, ...  
Allows adding specifications to a single configuration list attribute in multiple instances of an object with a 
single command. Currently supported objects are the queue, the host, the host group, the parallel environment, 
the resource quota sets and the checkpointing interface configuration being specified as 
*queue*, *exechost*, *hostgroup*, *pe*, *rqs* or *ckpt* in *obj_spec*. 

For the *obj_spec* *queue* the *obj_instance* can be a cluster queue name, a queue domain name or a queue instance 
name. Find more information concerning different queue names in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1). Depending on the type of 
the *obj_instance* this adds to the cluster queues attribute sublist the cluster queues implicit default 
configuration value or the queue domain configuration value or queue instance configuration value. 
The queue *load_thresholds* parameter is an example of a list attribute. With the `-aattr` option, entries can be 
added to such lists, while they can be deleted with `-dattr`, modified with `-mattr`, and replaced with `-rattr`. 

For the *obj_spec* *rqs* the *obj_instance* is a unique identifier for a specific rule. The identifier consists 
of a rule-set name and either the number of the rule in the list, or the name of the rule, separated by a /.  

The name of the configuration attribute to be enhanced is specified with *attr_name* followed by *val* as a 
*name=value* pair. The comma separated list of object instances (e.g., the list of queues) to which the changes have 
to be applied are specified at the end of the command.  

The following restriction applies: For the *exechost* object the *load_values* attribute cannot be modified 
(see xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5)). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -Aattr *obj_spec* *fname* *obj_instance*, ...

Adds attributes to an object.

Similar to `-aattr` (see below) but takes specifications for the object attributes to be enhanced from file named
*fname*. As opposed to `-aattr`, multiple attributes can be enhanced. Their specification has to be enlisted in
*fname* following the file format of the corresponding object (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) for the queue, 
for example). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -acal *calendar_name*
Adds a new calendar definition to the xxQS_NAMExx environment. Calendars are used in xxQS_NAMExx for defining
availability and unavailability schedules of queues. The format of a calendar definition is described in
xxqs_name_sxx_calendar_conf(5).

With the calendar name given in the option argument `qconf` will open a temporary file and start up an editor.
After entering the calendar definition and closing the editor the new calendar is checked and registered with
xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -Acal *fname*
Adds a new calendar definition to the xxQS_NAMExx environment. Calendars are used in xxQS_NAMExx for defining
availability and unavailability schedules of queues. The format of a calendar definition is described in
xxqs_name_sxx_calendar_conf(5). The calendar definition is taken from the file *fname*. Requires root/manager privileges.

## -ace *ce_name*
Adds a new complex entry to the complex list of the xxQS_NAMExx environment. Complex entries are used to define
resources that can be requested by jobs. The different attributes define the characteristics of that resource and
the way how xxQS_NAMExx should handle them. Find more information in xxqs_name_sxx_complex(5).  

With the *ce_name* given in the option argument `qconf` will open a temporary file and start up an editor.
After entering the resource definition and closing the editor the new complex entry is checked and registered with
xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -Ace *fname*
Adds a new complex entry to the complex list of the xxQS_NAMExx environment. Complex entries are used to define
resources that can be requested by jobs. The different attributes define the characteristics of that resource and
the way how xxQS_NAMExx should handle them. Find more information in xxqs_name_sxx_complex(5).  
The complex definition is taken from the file *fname*. Requires root/manager privileges.

## -ackpt *ckpt_name*
Adds a checkpointing environment under the name *ckpt_name* to the list of checkpointing environments maintained
by xxQS_NAMExx and to be usable to submit checkpointing jobs (see xxqs_name_sxx_checkpoint(5) for details on
the format of a checkpointing environment definition). `qconf` retrieves a default checkpointing environment
configuration and executes an editor to allow you to customize the checkpointing environment configuration. Upon
exit from the editor, the checkpointing environment is registered with xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8).
Requires root/manager privileges.

## -Ackpt *fname*
Add the checkpointing environment as defined in *fname* (see xxqs_name_sxx_checkpoint(5)) to the list of supported
checkpointing environments. Requires root/manager privileges.

## -aconf *host*, ...
Successively adds configurations (see xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5)) For the hosts in the comma separated *host* list.
For each *host*, an editor is invoked and the configuration for the host can be entered. The configuration is
registered with xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8) after saving the file and quitting the editor. Requires root/manager
privileges.

## -Aconf *fname_list*
Add the configurations (see xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5)) specified in the files enlisted in the comma separated
*fname_list*. The configuration is added for the host that is identical to the file name. Requires root/manager
privileges.

## -ae \[*host_template*\]
Adds a host to the list of xxQS_NAMExx execution hosts. If a queue is configured on a host this host is
automatically added to the xxQS_NAMExx execution host list. Adding execution hosts explicitly offers the
advantage to be able to specify parameters like load scale values with the registration of the execution host.
However, these parameters can be modified (from their defaults) at any later time via the `-me` option
described below.  
If the *host_template* argument is present, `qconf` retrieves the configuration of the specified execution
host from xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8) or a generic template otherwise. The template is then stored in a file and
`qconf` executes an editor to change the entries in the file. The format of the execution host specification is
described in xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5). When the changes are saved in the editor and the editor is quit them the new
execution host is registered with xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -Ae *fname*
Add the execution host defined in *fname* to the xxQS_NAMExx cluster. The format of the execution host specification
is described in xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -ah *hostname*,...
Adds hosts *hostname* to the xxQS_NAMExx trusted host list. A host must be in this list to execute administrative
xxQS_NAMExx commands, the sole exception to this being the execution of `qconf` on the xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8)
node. The default xxQS_NAMExx installation procedures add all designated execution hosts (see the `-ae`
option above) to the xxQS_NAMExx trusted host list automatically. Requires root/manager privileges.

## -ahgrp *group*
Adds a new host group with the name specified in *group*. This command invokes an editor that allows to
make required changes. After the editor is quit the new host group entry is registered. Requires
root/manager privileges.

## -Ahgrp *fname*
Add the host group configuration defined in *fname*. The file format of *fname* must comply to the format specified
in xxqs_name_sxx_hostgroup(5). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -am *user*,...
Adds the indicated users to the xxQS_NAMExx manager list. Requires root/manager privileges.

maintained by xxQS_NAMExx and to be usable to submit parallel jobs (see xxqs_name_sxx_pe(5) for details
on the format of a PE definition. `Qconf` retrieves a default PE configuration and executes an editor
to allow you to customize the PE configuration. Upon exit from the editor, the PE is registered with
xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). Requires root/manager privileges.

Requires root/manager privileges.

## -aq \[*queue_name*\]
`Qconf` retrieves the default cluster queue configuration (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)) and executes an editor
to allow you to customize the cluster queue configuration. Upon exit from the editor, the queue is registered with
xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). A minimal configuration requires only that the queue name and queue hostlist be set.
Requires root/manager privileges.

for the indicated host group are deleted, but not those which are set for the hosts contained by that host group. 

If the *attr_nm* is *'\*'*, all attribute values set for the given queue instance or domain are deleted.  

The main difference between `-dattr` and `-purge` is that `-dattr` removes a value from a single list attribute, 
whereas `-purge` removes one or more overriding attribute settings from a cluster queue configuration. With
`-purge`, the entire attribute is deleted for the given queue instance or queue domain.

## -rattr *obj_spec* *attr_name* *val* *obj_instance*,...

Allows replacing a single configuration list attribute in multiple instances of an object with a single command. 
Find more information concerning *obj_spec* and *obj_instance* in the description of `-aattr`.
Requires root/manager privilege.

## -Rattr *obj_spec* *fname* *obj_instance*, ...
Replace object attributes. Similar to `-rattr` (see below) but the definition of the list attributes whose content is
to be replace is contained in the file named *fname*. As opposed to `-rattr`, multiple attributes can be modified.
Their specification has to be enlisted in *fname* following the file format of the corresponding object
(see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) for the queue, for example). Requires root/manager privileges.

## -rsstnode *node_path*,...  
Recursively shows the name and shares of the specified share tree node(s) and the names and shares of its child nodes. 
(see xxqs_name_sxx_share_tree(5)). The *node_path* is a hierarchical path (\[/\]node_name\[\[/.\]node_name...\]) 
specifying the location of a node in the share tree.

## -sc
Display the complex configuration.

## -sce *ce_name*
Show the definition of the complex entry specified by *ce_name*.

## -scel
Show a list of all currently defined complex entry names. To get the full complex configuration use `-sc'`

## -scal *calendar_name*
Display the configuration of the specified calendar.

## -scall 
Show a list of all calendars currently defined.

## -scat *cat_id*
Display characteristics of the given category ID *cat_id*. IDs of existing categories can be obtained from the output of `-scatl`.

## -sckpt *ckpt_name*
Display the configuration of the specified checkpointing environment.

## -sckptl
Show a list of names of all checkpointing environments currently configured.

## -sconf \[*host*,...\ | **global**\] 
If the optional comma separated host list argument is omitted or the special string **global** is given, the global 
configuration is displayed. The configuration in effect on a certain host is the merger of the global
configuration and the host specific local configuration. The format of the configuration is described in 
xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5).

## -sconfl
Display a list of hosts for which configurations are available. The special host name **global** refers to the 
global configuration.

## -sds 
Displays detached settings in the cluster configuration.

## -se *hostname*
Displays the definition of the specified execution host.

## -secl
Displays the xxQS_NAMExx event client list.

## -sel  
Displays the xxQS_NAMExx execution host list.

## -sep
**Note:** Deprecated, may be removed in future release.

Displays a list of virtual processors. This value is taken from the underlying OS and it depends on underlying 
hardware and operating system whether this value represents sockets, cores or supported threads.

If this option is used in combination with `-cb` parameter then two additional columns will be shown in the output 
for the number of sockets and number of cores. Currently, xxQS_NAMExx will enlist these values only if the
corresponding operating system of execution host is Linux under kernel >= 2.6.16, or Solaris 10. Other operating 
systems or versions might be supported with the future update releases. In case these values won't be retrieved, 
'0' will be displayed.

## -sh
Displays the xxQS_NAMExx administrative host list.

## -shgrp *group*
Displays the host group entries for the group specified in *group*.

## -shgrpl 
Displays a name list of all currently defined host groups which have a valid host group configuration.

## -shgrp_tree *group*
Shows a tree like structure of a host group.

## -shgrp_resolved *group* 
Shows a list of all hosts which are part of the definition of host group. If the host group definition contains 
sub host groups than also these groups are resolved and the hostnames are printed.

## -srqs \[*rqs_name_list*\]  
Show the definition of the resource quota sets (RQS) specified by the argument list.

## -srqsl
Show a list of all currently defined resource quota (RQS) sets.

## -sm 
Displays the managers list.

## -so
Displays the operator list.

## -sobjl *obj_spec* *attr_name* *val*  
Shows a list of all configuration objects for which *val* matches at least one configuration value of the attributes 
whose name matches with *attr_name*.

*obj_spec* can be **queue** or **queue_domain** or **queue_instance** or **exechost**. **Note** When **queue_domain** 
or **queue_instance** is specified as *obj_spec* matching is only done with the attribute overriding concerning 
the host group or the execution host. In this case queue domain names resp. queue instances are returned.

*attr_name* can be any of the configuration file keywords enlisted in xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) or 
xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5). Also wildcards can be used to match multiple attributes.

*val* can be an arbitrary string or a wildcard expression.

## -sp *pe_name*
Show the definition of the parallel environment (PE) specified by *pe_name*.

## -spl 
Show a list of all currently defined parallel environment (PE) objects.

## -sprj *project*
Shows the definition of the specified project (see xxqs_name_sxx_project(5)).

## -sprjl
Shows the list of all currently defined projects.

## -sq *wc_queue_list*

xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

## -sql
Shows a list of all currently defined cluster queues.

## -ss
Displays the xxQS_NAMExx submit host list.

## -ssconf  
Displays the current scheduler configuration in the format explained in xxqs_name_sxx_sched_conf(5).

## -sstnode *node_path*,...
Shows the name and shares of the specified share tree node(s) (see xxqs_name_sxx_share_tree(5)). The *node_path* 
is a hierarchical path (**\[/\]node_name\[\[/.\]node_name...\])** specifying the location of a node in the share tree.

## -sstree
Shows the definition of the share tree (see xxqs_name_sxx_share_tree(5)).

## -sst
Shows the definition of the share tree in a tree view (see xxqs_name_sxx_share_tree(5)).

## -sss

is running.

## -su *acl_name*
Displays a xxQS_NAMExx access control list (ACL).

## -sul  
Displays a list of names of all currently defined xxQS_NAMExx access control lists (ACL).

## -suser user,...
Shows the definition of the specified user(s) (see xxqs_name_sxx_user(5)).

## -suserl 
Shows the list of all currently defined users.

## -tsm  
The xxQS_NAMExx scheduler is forced by this option to print trace messages of its next scheduling run to the file
*\<xxQS_NAME_Sxx_ROOT\>/\<xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL\>/common/schedd_runlog*. The messages indicate the reasons for jobs and queues not 
being selected in that run. Requires root/manager privileges.

**Note** The reasons for job requirements being invalid with respect to resource availability of queues are 
displayed using the format as described for the `qstat` *-F* option (see description of
**Full Format** in section **OUTPUT FORMATS** of the qstat(1) manual page.
