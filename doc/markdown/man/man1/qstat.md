# DESCRIPTION

`qstat` shows the current status of the available xxQS_NAMExx queues and the jobs associated with the queues. Selection 
options allow you to get or filter information about specific jobs, queues or users. If multiple selections are done a queue 
is only displayed if all selection criteria for a queue instance are met. Without any option `qstat` will display only 
a list of jobs with no queue status information.

The administrator and the user may define files (see xxqs_name_sxx_qstat(5)), which can contain any of the options 
described below. A cluster-wide xxqs_name_sxx_qstat file may be placed under 
*\$xxQS_NAME_Sxx_ROOT/\$xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL/common/xxqs_name_sxx_qstat* The user private file is searched at the location 
*\$HOME/.sge_qstat*. The home directory request file has the highest precedence over the cluster global file. Command 
line can be used to override the flags contained in the files.

# OPTIONS

## -explain *a*\|*A*\|*c*\|*E*  
The character *c* displays the reason for the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state of a queue instance. *a* shows the 
reason for the a(larm state). Suspend alarm state reasons will be displayed by *A*. *E* displays the reason for a 
queue instance error state.

The output format for the alarm reasons is one line per reason containing the resource value and threshold. 
For details about the resource value please refer to the description of the *Full Format* in section 
*OUTPUT FORMATS* below.

## -ext  
Displays additional information for each job related to the job ticket policy scheme (see *OUTPUT FORMATS* below).

## -f  
Specifies a "full" format display of information. The `-f` option causes summary information on all queues to be 
displayed along with the queued job list. Might be combined with `-sdv` to filter the output to a department specific
view that considers the user's access rights and the department definitions.

## -F \[*resource_name*,...\]  
Like in the case of `-f` information is displayed on all jobs as well as queues. In addition, `qstat` will present 
a detailed listing of the current resource availability per queue with respect to all resources (if the option 
argument is omitted) or with respect to those resources contained in the resource_name list. Please refer to the 
description of the *Full Format* in section *OUTPUT FORMATS* below for further detail.

## -g {c\|d\|t}+ 
The `-g` option allows for controlling grouping of displayed objects.

With `-g` *c* a cluster queue summary is displayed. Find more information in the section *OUTPUT FORMATS*.

With `-g` *d* array jobs are displayed verbosely in a one line per job task fashion. By default, array jobs are 
grouped and all tasks with the same status (for pending tasks only) are displayed in a single line. The array job 
task id range field in the output (see section *OUTPUT FORMATS*) specifies the corresponding set of tasks.

With `-g` *t* parallel jobs are displayed verbosely in a one line per parallel job task fashion. By default, 
parallel job tasks are displayed in a single line. Also with `-g` *t* option the function of each parallel task is 
displayed rather than the jobs slot amount (see section *OUTPUT FORMATS*).

## -help  
Prints a listing of all options.

## -j \[job_list\]  
Prints either for all pending jobs or the jobs contained in job_list various information. The job_list can contain 
job_ids, job_names, or wildcard expression xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

For jobs in E(rror) state the error reason is displayed. For jobs that could not be dispatched during in the last 
scheduling interval the obstacles are shown, if 'schedd_job_info' in xxqs_name_sxx_sched_conf(5) is configured 
accordingly.

For running jobs available information on resource utilization is shown about consumed cpu time in seconds, integral 
memory usage in Gbytes seconds, amount of data transferred in io operations, current virtual memory utilization in 
Mbytes, and maximum virtual memory utilization in Mbytes. This information is not available if resource utilization
retrieval is not supported for the OS platform where the job is hosted.

In combination with `-cp` the output of this command will additionally contain the information of a requested binding 
(see `-bamount` of qsub(1)) and the changes that have been applied to the topology string (real binding) for the host 
where this job is running.

The topology string will contain capital letters for all those cores that were not bound to the displayed job. Bound 
cores will be shown lowercase (E.g "SCCcCSCCcC" means that core 2 on the two available sockets where bound to this 
job).

Please refer to the file \<xxqs_name_sxx_root>/doc/load_parameters.asc for detailed information on the standard set 
of load values.

## -l resource\[=value\],...  
Defines the resources required by the jobs or granted by the queues on which information is requested. Matching is 
performed on queues based on non-mutable resource availability information only. That means load values are always 
ignored except the so-called static load values (i.e. *arch*, *num_proc*, *mem_total*, *swap_total* and 
*virtual_total*).
Consumable utilization is also ignored. The pending jobs are restricted to jobs that might run in one of the above 
queues. In a similar fashion also the queue-job matching bases only on non-mutable resource availability information. 
If there are multiple `-l` resource requests they will be concatenated by a logical AND: a queue needs to match all
resources to be displayed.

## -ne  
In combination with `-f` the option suppresses the display of empty queues. This means all queues where actually no 
jobs are running are not displayed.

## -ncb  
In combination with `-ncb` the output of a command will suppress information of a requested binding and changes 
that have been applied to the topology string (real binding) for the host where the job is running. This information 
will disappear in combination with the parameters `-r` and `-j`.

Please note that this command line switch is intended to provide backward compatibility and will be removed in the 
next major release.

## -pe *pe_name*,...  
Displays status information with respect to queues which are attached to at least one of the parallel environments 
enlisted in the comma separated option argument. Status information for jobs is displayed either for those which 
execute in one of the selected queues or which are pending and might get scheduled to those queues in principle.

## -pri  
Displays additional information for each job related to the job priorities in general. (see *OUTPUT FORMATS* below).

## -q wc_queue_list  
Specifies a wildcard expression queue list to which job information is to be displayed. Find the definition of 
*wc_queue_list* in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

## -qs {*a*\|*c*\|*d*\|*o*\|*s*\|*u*\|*A*\|*C*\|*D*\|*E*\|*S*}  
Allows for the filtering of queue instances according to state.

## -r  
Prints extended information about the resource requirements of the displayed jobs.

Please refer to the *OUTPUT FORMATS* sub-section *Expanded Format* below for detailed information.

## -s {*p*\|*r*\|*s*\|*z*\|*hu*\|*ho*\|*hs*\|*hd*\|*hj*\|*ha*\|*h*\|*a*}\[+\]  
Prints only jobs in the specified state, any combination of states is possible. `-s` *prs* corresponds to the regular 
`qstat` output without `-s` at all. To show recently finished jobs, use `-s` *z*. To display jobs in 
user/operator/system/array-dependency hold, use the `-s` *hu*/*ho*/*hs*/*hd* option. The `-s` *ha* option shows jobs 
which where submitted with the `qsub -a` command. `qstat -s` *hj* displays all jobs which are not eligible for 
execution unless the job has entries in the job dependency list. `qstat -s` *h* is an abbreviation for 
`qstat -s` *huhohshdhjha* and `qstat -s` is an abbreviation for `qstat -s` *psr* (see `-a`, `-hold_jid` and 
`-hold_jid_ad` options to qsub(1)).

## -sdv
This switch is available in Gridware Cluster Scheduler only.

This option is only effective if the executing user has no administrative rights.

If the `-sdv` option is used, the output of the command will be restricted to a department specific view. This means
that following parts of the output will be suppressed:

* host information where the user has no access rights
* queue instance information where the user has no access rights
* queue instance information if the corresponding host is not accessible by the user
* jobs that are not owned by the user or by a user that is in the same department as the user that executes `qhost`
* job information if the host or queue instance is not accessible by the user

Please be aware that changing access permissions for a user that has active jobs in a queue or on a host where access is 
removed will not affect the running jobs. The jobs will continue to run until they finish, but this will lead to a 
situation where the job owner cannot see the jobs anymore in case the department view is enforced.

The department specific view can be enforced by adding the `-sdv` switch to the $HOME/.sge_qstat file.
Administrators can enforce this behavior by adding this switch to the default sge_qstat files

The `-sdv` option is also available in the `qselect` command where it has the same effect to suppress information about
queues where the user has no access rights.

## -t  
Prints extended information about the controlled sub-tasks of the displayed parallel jobs. Please refer to the 
*OUTPUT FORMATS* subsection *Reduced Format* below for detailed information. Sub-tasks of parallel jobs should not 
be confused with array job tasks (see `-g` option above and `-t` option to qsub(1)).

## -U user,...  
Displays status information with respect to queues to which the specified users have access. Status information for 
jobs is displayed either for those which execute in one of the selected queues or which are pending and might get 
scheduled to those queues in principle.

## -u user,...  
Display information only on those jobs and queues being associated with the users from the given user list. Queue 
status information is displayed if the `-f` or `-F` options are specified additionally and if the user runs jobs in 
those queues.

The string *$user* is a placeholder for the current username. An asterisk * can be used as username wildcard to 
request any user's jobs be displayed. The default value for this switch is `-u $user`.

The `-sdv` switch can be used to add a department specific filter that considers the user's access rights
and the department definitions. Although `-u *` would show all jobs in the system, `-u * -sdv` combination will further
filter the output so that only those jobs will be shown that belong to the users or to other users in the same
department as the user that executes `qstat`.

## -urg  
Displays additional information for each job related to the job urgency policy scheme (see *OUTPUT FORMATS* below).

## -xml  
This option can be used with all other options and changes the output to XML. The used schemas are referenced in the 
XML output. The output is printed to stdout. For more detailed information, the schemas for the `qstat` command can be 
found in $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat.

If the `-xml` parameter is combined with `-ncb` then the XML output does not contain tags with information about 
job to core binding. You can also find schema files with the suffix "\_ncb" in the directory
$SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat that describe that changes.  

In combination with `-sdv` the XML output will be restricted to a department specific view. This means that the XML
output will be restricted to the information according to access and department rights.

# OUTPUT FORMATS

Depending on the presence or absence of the `-explain`, `-f`, `-F`, or `-qs` and `-r` and `-t` option three 
output formats need to be differentiated.

The `-ext` and `-urg` options may be used to display additional information for each job.

## Cluster Queue Format (with -g c)

Following the header line a section for each cluster queue is provided. When queue instances selection are 
applied (`-l`, `-pe`, `-q`, `-U`) the cluster format contains only cluster queues of the corresponding queue
instances.

-   the cluster queue name.

-   an average of the normalized load average of all queue hosts. In order to reflect each hosts different significance 
    the number of configured slots is used as a weighting factor when determining cluster queue load. Please note that 
    only hosts with a np_load_value are considered for this value. When queue selection is applied only data about 
    selected queues is considered in this formula. If the load value is not available at any of the hosts *-NA-* is 
    printed instead of the value from the complex attribute definition.

-   the number of currently used slots.

-   the number of slots reserved in advance.

-   the number of currently available slots.

-   the total number of slots.

-   the number of slots which is in at least one of the states *aoACDS* and in none of the states *cdsuE*

-   the number of slots which are in one of these states or in any combination of them: *cdsuE*

-   the `-g` *c* option can be used in combination with `-ext`. In this case, additional columns are added to the 
    output. Each column contains the slot count for one of the available queue states.

## Reduced Format (without -f, -F, and -qs)

Following the header line a line is printed for each job consisting of

-   the job ID.

-   the priority of the job determining its position in the pending jobs list. The priority value is determined 
    dynamically based on ticket and urgency policy set-up (see also xxqs_name_sxx_priority(5)).

-   the name of the job.

-   the username of the job owner.

-   the status of the job - one of d(eletion), E(rror), h(old), r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended), 
    t(ransfering), T(hreshold) or w(aiting).

The state d(eletion) indicates that a qdel(1) has been used to initiate job deletion. The states t(ransfering) 
and r(unning) indicate that a job is about to be executed or is already executing, whereas the states s(uspended), 
S(uspended) and T(hreshold) show that an already running jobs has been suspended. The s(uspended) state is caused 
by suspending the job via the qmod(1) command, the S(uspended) state indicates that the queue containing the job 
is suspended and therefore the job is also suspended and the T(hreshold) state shows that at least one suspend 
threshold of the corresponding queue was exceeded (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)) and that the job has been 
suspended as a consequence. The state R(estarted) indicates that the job was restarted. This can be caused by a job 
migration or because of one of the reasons described in the -r section of the qsub(1) command.

The states w(aiting) and h(old) only appear for pending jobs. The h(old) state indicates that a job currently is not 
eligible for execution due to a hold state assigned to it via qhold(1), qalter(1) or the qsub(1) `-h` option or that 
the job is waiting for completion of the jobs to which job dependencies have been assigned to the job via the
`-hold_jid` or `-hold_jid-ad` options of qsub(1) or qalter(1).

The state E(rror) appears for pending jobs that couldn't be started due to job properties. The reason for the job 
error is shown by the `qstat -j` *job_list* option.

-   the submission or start time and date of the job.

-   the queue the job is assigned to (for running or suspended jobs only).

-   the number of job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if `-g` *t* is specified.

    Without `-g` *t* option the total number of slots occupied resp. requested by the job is displayed. For pending 
    parallel jobs with a PE slot range request, the assumed future slot allocation is displayed. With `-g` *t* option 
    the function of the running jobs (MASTER or SLAVE - the latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

-   the array job task id. Will be empty for non-array jobs. See the `-t` option to qsub(1) and the `-g` above for 
    additional information.

    If the `-t` option is supplied, each status line always contains parallel job task information as if `-g` *t* 
    were specified and each line contains the following parallel job subtask information:

-   the parallel task ID (do not confuse parallel tasks with array job tasks),

-   the status of the parallel task - one of r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), 
    h(old), or x(exited).

-   the cpu, memory, and I/O usage,

-   the exit status of the parallel task,

-   and the failure code and message for the parallel task.

## Full Format (with -f and -F)

Following the header line a section for each queue separated by a horizontal line is provided. For each queue the 
information printed consists of

-   the queue name,

-   the queue type - one of B(atch), I(nteractive), C(heckpointing), P(arallel) or combinations thereof or N(one),

-   the number of used and available job slots,

-   the load average of the queue host,

-   the architecture of the queue host and

-   the state of the queue - one of u(nknown) if the corresponding xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) cannot be contacted, 
    a(larm), A(larm), C(alendar suspended), s(uspended), S(ubordinate), d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror) or 
    combinations thereof.

If the state is a(larm) at least on of the load thresholds defined in the *load_thresholds* list of the queue 
configuration (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)) is currently exceeded, which prevents from scheduling further jobs 
to that queue.

As opposed to this, the state A(larm) indicates that at least one of the suspend thresholds of the queue (see
xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)) is currently exceeded. This will result in jobs running in that queue being successively 
suspended until no threshold is violated.

The states s(uspended) and d(isabled) can be assigned to queues and released via the qmod(1) command. Suspending a 
queue will cause all jobs executing in that queue to be suspended.

The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that the queue has been disabled or suspended automatically 
via the calendar facility of xxQS_NAMExx (see xxqs_name_sxx_calendar_conf(5)), while the S(ubordinate) state
indicates, that the queue has been suspended via subordination to another queue (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) 
for details). When suspending a queue (regardless of the cause) all jobs executing in that queue are suspended too.

If an E(rror) state is displayed for a queue, xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) on that host was unable to locate the 
xxqs_name_sxx_shepherd(8) executable on that host in order to start a job. Please check the error logfile of that 
xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) for leads on how to resolve the problem. Please enable the queue afterward via the `-c` option 
of the qmod(1) command manually.

If the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state is displayed for a queue instance this indicates that the configuration 
specified for this queue instance in xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5) is ambiguous. This state is cleared when the configuration 
becomes unambiguous again. This state prevents further jobs from being scheduled to that queue instance. Detailed 
reasons why a queue instance entered the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state can be found in the xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8) 
messages file and are shown by the `qstat -explain` switch. For queue instances in this state the cluster queue's
default settings are used for the ambiguous attribute.

If an o(rphaned) state is displayed for a queue instance, it indicates that the queue instance is no longer demanded 
by the current cluster queue's configuration or the host group configuration. The queue instance is kept because jobs 
which not yet finished jobs are still associated with it, and it will vanish from qstat output when these jobs have 
finished. To quicken vanishing of an orphaned queue instance associated job(s) can be deleted using qdel(1). A 
queue instance in (o)rphaned state can be revived by changing the cluster queue configuration accordingly to cover 
that queue instance. This state prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue instance.

If the `-F` option was used, resource availability information is printed following the queue status line. For each 
resource (as selected in an option argument to **-F** or for all resources if the option argument was omitted) a 
single line is displayed with the following format:

-   a one letter specifier indicating whether the current resource availability value was dominated by either  
    *g* - a cluster global,  
    *h* - a host total or  
    *q* - a queue related resource consumption.

-   a second one letter specifier indicating the source for the current resource availability value, being one of  
    *l* - a load value reported for the resource,  
    *L* - a load value for the resource after administrator defined load scaling has been applied,  
    *c* - availability derived from the consumable resources facility (see xxqs_name_sxx_complexes(5)),  
    *f* - a fixed availability definition derived from a non-consumable complex attribute or a fixed resource limit.

-   after a colon the name of the resource on which information is displayed.

-   after an equal sign the current resource availability value.

The displayed availability values and the sources from which they derive are always the minimum values of all possible 
combinations. Hence, for example, a line of the form "qf:h_vmem=4G" indicates that a queue currently has a maximum 
availability in virtual memory of 4 Gigabyte, where this value is a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in the queue
configuration) and it is queue dominated, i.e. the host in total may have more virtual memory available than this, 
but the queue doesn't allow for more. Contrarily a line "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an upper bound of 4 
Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but the limit would be derived from a load value currently reported for the host. 
So while the queue might allow for jobs with higher virtual memory requirements, the host on which this particular 
queue resides currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

If the `-explain` option was used with the character *a* or *A*, information about resources is displayed, that 
violate load or suspend thresholds. The same format as with the `-F` option is used with following extensions:

-   the line starts with the keyword *alarm*  

-   appended to the resource value is the type and value of the
    appropriate threshold

After the queue status line (in case of `-f`) or the resource availability information (in case of `-F`) a single 
line is printed for each job running currently in this queue. Each job status line contains

-   the job ID,

-   the priority of the job determining its position in the pending jobs list. The priority value is determined 
    dynamically based on ticket and urgency policy set-up (see also *sge_priority*(5) ).

-   the job name,

-   the job owner name,

-   the status of the job - one of t(ransfering), r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) 
    (see the *Reduced Format* section for detailed information),

-   the submission or start time and date of the job.

-   the number of job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if `-g` *t* is specified.

Without `-g` *t* option the number of slots occupied per queue resp. requested by the job is displayed. For pending 
parallel jobs with a PE slot range request, the assumed future slot allocation is displayed. With `-g` *t* option 
the function of the running jobs (MASTER or SLAVE - the latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

If the `-t` option is supplied, each job status line also contains

-   the task ID,

-   the status of the task - one of r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), h(old), 
    or x(exited) (see the *Reduced Format* section for detailed information),

-   the cpu, memory, and I/O usage,

-   the exit status of the task,

-   and the failure code and message for the task.

Following the list of queue sections a *PENDING JOBS* list may be printed in case jobs are waiting for being assigned 
to a queue. A status line for each waiting job is displayed being similar to the one for the running jobs. The 
differences are that the status for the jobs is w(aiting) or h(old), that the submit time and date is shown instead of
the start time and that no function is displayed for the jobs.

In very rare cases, e.g. if xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8) starts up from an inconsistent state in the job or queue spool 
files or if the clean queue (`-cq`) option of qconf(1) is used, `qstat` cannot assign jobs to either the running or 
pending jobs section of the output. In this case as job status inconsistency (e.g. a job has a running status
but is not assigned to a queue) has been detected. Such jobs are printed in an *ERROR JOBS* section at the very end 
of the output. The ERROR JOBS section should disappear upon restart of xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). Please contact your 
xxQS_NAMExx support representative if you feel uncertain about the cause or effects of such jobs.

## Expanded Format (with -r)

If the `-r` option was specified together with `qstat`, the following information for each displayed job is printed 
(a single line for each of the following job characteristics):

-   The job and master queue name.

-   The hard and soft resource requirements of the job as specified with the qsub(1) `-l` option. The per resource 
    addend when determining the jobs urgency contribution value is printed (see also xxqs_name_sxx_priority(5)).

-   The requested parallel environment including the desired queue slot
    range (see `-pe` option of qsub(1)).

-   The requested checkpointing environment of the job (see the qsub(1) `-ckpt` option).

-   In case of running jobs, the granted parallel environment with the granted number of queue slots.

-   The requested job binding parameters.

## Enhanced Output (with -ext)

For each job the following additional items are displayed:

ntckts  
The total number of tickets in normalized fashion.

project  
The project to which the job is assigned as specified in the qsub(1) `-P` option.

department

department definitions).

cpu  
The current accumulated CPU usage of the job in seconds.

mem  
The current accumulated memory usage of the job in Gbytes seconds.

io  
The current accumulated IO usage of the job.

tckts

dlcontr  
The urgency value contribution that reflects the urgency related to the jobs deadline initiation time.

deadline  
The deadline initiation time of the job as specified with the qsub(1) `-dl` option.

## Enhanced Output (with -pri)

For each job, the following additional job priority related items are displayed (see also xxqs_name_sxx_priority(5)):

nurg  
The job's total urgency value in normalized fashion.

npprior  
The job's **-p** priority in normalized fashion.

ntckts  
The job's ticket amount in normalized fashion.

ppri  
The job's **-p** priority as specified by the user.

# ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

For a complete list of common environment variables used by all xxQS_NAMExx commands, see xxqs_name_sxx_intro(1).

SGE_LONG_QNAMES  
`qstat` does display queue names up to 30 characters. If that is too much or not enough, one can set a custom length 
with this variable. The minimum display length is 10 characters. If one does not know the best display length, one 
can set *SGE_LONG_QNAMES* to -1 and `qstat` will figure out the best length.
