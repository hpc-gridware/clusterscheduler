# NAME

`qmod` - modify a xxQS_NAMExx queue and running job

# SYNTAX

`qmod` \[ *\<options\>* \] \[ *wc_job_range_list* \| *wc_queue_list*
\]

# DESCRIPTION

`Qmod` enables users classified as *owners* (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) for details) of a workstation to modify 
the state of xxQS_NAMExx queues for his/her machine as well as the state of his/her own jobs. A manager/operator or 
root can execute `qmod` for any queue and job in a cluster but only from administrative hosts. Find additional 
information concerning *wc_queue_list* and *wc_job_list* in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

# OPTIONS

## -c  
**Note:** Deprecated, may be removed in future release. Please use the `-cj` or `-cq` switch instead.  
Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s)/queue(s).

## -cj  
Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s).

## -cq  
Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).

## -d  
Disables the queue(s), i.e. no further jobs are dispatched to disabled queues while jobs already executing in 
these queues are allowed to finish.

## -e  
Enables the queue(s).

## -f  
Force the modification action for the queue despite the apparent current state of the queue. For example if a 
queue appears to be suspended but the job execution seems to be continuing the manager/operator can force a suspend 
operation which will send a SIGSTOP to the jobs. In any case, the queue or job status will be set even if the
xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) controlling the queues/jobs cannot be reached. Requires manager/operator privileges.

## -help  
Prints a listing of all options.

## -r  
**Note:** Deprecated, may be removed in future release. Please use the `-rj` or `-rq` switch instead.  
If applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running in this queue. If applied to running jobs, 
reschedules the jobs. Requires manager or operator privileges. In order for a job to be rescheduled, it or the
queue in which it is executing must have the rerun flag activated (see `-r` option in the qsub(1) man page and 
the *rerun* option in the xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) man page for more information). Additional restrictions
apply for parallel and checkpointing jobs. (See the *reschedule_unknown* description in the xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5) 
man page for details).

## -rj  
If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs. Requires manager/operator privileges.

## -rq  
If applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running in this queue. Requires manager/operator privileges.

## -s  
**Note:** Deprecated, may be removed in future release. Please use the`-sj` or `-sq` switch instead.  
If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any jobs which might be active. If applied to running jobs, 
suspends the jobs.

## -sj  
If applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs. If a job is both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its 
queue, a following unsuspend of the queue will not release the suspension state on the job.

## -sq  
If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any jobs which might be active.

## -us  
**Note:** Deprecated, may be removed in future release. Please use the `-usj` or `-usq` switch instead.  
If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any jobs which might be active. If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs.

## -usj  
If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs. If a job is both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its queue, a 
following unsuspend of the queue will not release the suspension state on the job.

## -usq  
If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any jobs which might be active.
