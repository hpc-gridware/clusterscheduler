# NAME

xxqs_name_sxx_checkpoint - xxQS_NAMExx checkpointing environment configuration file format

# DESCRIPTION

Checkpointing is a facility to save the complete status of an executing program or job and to restore and restart from 
this so called checkpoint at a later point of time if the original program or job was halted, e.g. through a system 
crash.

xxQS_NAMExx provides various levels of checkpointing support (see xxqs_name_sxx_ckpt(5)). The checkpointing environment 
described here is a means to configure the different types of checkpointing in use for your xxQS_NAMExx cluster or 
parts thereof. For that purpose you can define the operations which have to be executed in initiating a checkpoint 
generation, a migration of a checkpoint to another host or a restart of a checkpointed application as well as the 
list of queues which are eligible for a checkpointing method.

Supporting different operating systems may easily force xxQS_NAMExx to introduce operating system dependencies for 
the configuration of the checkpointing configuration file and updates of the supported operating system versions may 
lead to frequently changing implementation details. Please refer to the \<xxqs_name_sxx_root>/ckpt directory for more
information.

Please use the `-ackpt`, `-dckpt`, `-mckpt` or `-sckpt` options to the qconf(1) command to manipulate checkpointing 
environments from the command-line.

Note, xxQS_NAMExx allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline (\\newline) characters. The backslash and the 
newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any interpretation.

# FORMAT

The format of a *checkpoint* file is defined as follows:

## *ckpt_name*

The name of the checkpointing environment as defined for *ckpt_name* in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1).

qsub(1) `-ckpt` switch or for the qconf(1) options mentioned above.

## *interface*

The type of checkpointing to be used. Currently, the following types are valid:

* hibernator  
  The Hibernator kernel level checkpointing is interfaced.

* cpr  
  The SGI kernel level checkpointing is used.

* cray-ckpt  
  The Cray kernel level checkpointing is assumed.

* transparent  
  xxQS_NAMExx assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to this checkpointing interface use a checkpointing 
  library such as provided by the public domain package *Condor*.

* userdefined  
  xxQS_NAMExx assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to this checkpointing interface perform their 
  private checkpointing method.

* application-level  
  Uses all the interface commands configured in the checkpointing object like in the case of one of the kernel 
  level checkpointing interfaces (*cpr*, *cray-ckpt*, etc.) except for the *restart_command* (see below), which is 
  not used (even if it is configured) but the job script is invoked in case of a restart instead.

## *ckpt_command*

A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx in order to initiate a checkpoint.

## *migr_command*

A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx during a migration of a checkpointing job from 
one host to another.

## *restart_command*

A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx when restarting a previously checkpointed application.

## *clean_command*

A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx in order to cleanup after a checkpointed 
application has finished.

## *ckpt_dir*

A file system location to which checkpoints of potentially considerable size should be stored.

## *ckpt_signal*

A Unix signal to be sent to a job by xxQS_NAMExx to initiate a checkpoint generation. The value for this field can 
either be a symbolic name from the list produced by the `-l` option of the kill(1) command or an integer number 
which must be a valid signal on the systems used for checkpointing.

## *when*

The points of time when checkpoints are expected to be generated. Valid values for this parameter are composed 
by the letters *s*, *m*, *x* and *r* and any combinations thereof without any separating character in
between. The same letters are allowed for the *-c* option of the qsub(1) command which will overwrite the definitions 
in the used checkpointing environment. The meaning of the letters is defined as
follows:

* *s* - A job is checkpointed, aborted and if possible migrated if the corresponding xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8) is 
   shut down on the job's machine.

* *m* - Checkpoints are generated periodically at the *min_cpu_interval* interval defined by the queue (see 
   xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)) in which a job executes.

* *x* - A job is checkpointed, aborted and if possible migrated as soon as the job gets suspended (manually as 
   well as automatically).

* *r* - A job will be rescheduled (not checkpointed) when the host on which the job currently runs went into 
  unknown state and the time interval *reschedule_unknown* (see xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5)) defined in the global/local 
  cluster configuration will be exceeded.

# RESTRICTIONS

Note, that the functionality of any checkpointing, migration or restart procedures provided by default with the 
xxQS_NAMExx distribution as well as the way how they are invoked in the *ckpt_command*, *migr_command* or 
*restart_command* parameters of any default checkpointing environments should not be changed or otherwise the
functionality remains the full responsibility of the administrator configuring the checkpointing environment. 
xxQS_NAMExx will just invoke these procedures and evaluate their exit status. If the procedures do not perform their 
tasks properly or are not invoked in a proper fashion, the checkpointing mechanism may behave unexpectedly, 
xxQS_NAMExx has no means to detect this.
