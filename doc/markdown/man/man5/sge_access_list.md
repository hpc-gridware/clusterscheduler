# NAME

xxqs_name_sxx_access_list - xxQS_NAMExx access list file format

# DESCRIPTION

Access lists are used in xxQS_NAMExx to define access permissions of users to

* the cluster (see (x)user_lists in xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5))
* hosts (see (x)user_lists in xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5))
* queues (see (x)user_lists in xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5))
* parallel environments (see (x)user_lists in xxqs_name_sxx_pe(5))
* cluster resources limited by resource quotas (see xxqs_name_sxx_resource_quote(5))

A list of currently configured access lists can be displayed via the `qconf -sul` option. The contents of each
enlisted access list can be shown via the `-su` switch. The output follows the xxqs_name_sxx_access_list(5) format
description. New access lists can be created and existing can be modified via the `-au` and `-du` options
to `qconf`.

Departments are a special form of access list that additionally allow assignment of 
functional shares and override tickets.

Note, xxQS_NAMExx allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline (\\newline) characters. The backslash and the 
newline are replaced with a space (" ") character before any interpretation.

Following predefined access lists gain access to specific functionalities of the xxQS_NAMExx system:

## arusers

Allows to submit, control and delete advance reservations (see qsub(1)).

## deadlineusers

Allows to specify a deadline for jobs (see qsub(1) -dl).

## defaultdepartment

The *defaultdepartment* is the default department for users that are not assigned to any other department.
In difference to other departments, users or groups of users must not explicitly be referenced in the *entries* field of the *defaultdepartment* so that a user can be part of the *defaultdepartment*.

# FORMAT

The following list of access list parameters specifies the access list content:

## *name*

The name of the access list as defined for *userset_name* in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1). 

Usernames and names of user sets can share the same namespace. In order to avoid collisions, user sets should be prefixed or suffixed with an unique character sequence that will not appear in usernames (for example, 'department' or 'users' as suffix). If there are collisions then usernames will be preferred over user sets.

## *type*

The type of the access list, currently one of *ACL,* or *DEPT* or a combination of both in a comma separated list. 
Depending on this parameter the access list can be used as access list only or as a department.

## *oticket*

The amount of override tickets currently assigned to the department.

## *fshare*

The current functional share of the department.

## *entries*

The *entries* parameter contains the comma separated list of those UNIX users (see *user_name* in 
xxqs_name_sxx_types(1)) or those UNIX groups that are assigned to the access list or the department. 

By default, only a user's primary UNIX group is considered to gain/reject access. Supplementary groups are only 
considered if the parameter `ENABLE_SUP_GRP_EVAL=1` is defined as *qmaster_param* in the configuration. 

A group is differentiated from a username by prefixing the group name with a '@' sign. For UNIX groups that have no 
symbolic name it is allowed to specify the '@' character followed by the UNIX group ID.

Pure access lists allow enlisting any user or group in any access list.

When using departments, each user or group enlisted *should* only be enlisted in one department, in order to ensure a 
unique assignment of jobs to departments. It is allowed to enlist a user or group in multiple departments, but
this will automatically lead to a random assignment of jobs to departments if the submitting user of a job does not
specify a department explicitly using the `-dept` switch during job submission.

If a user does not belong to any department, the *defaultdepartment* is assigned, if existing.

Displaying commands like qstat(1) and qhost(1) allow to provide a department specific view by using the `-sdv` switch.
Those commands will then show hosts/queues/job information in the context of the department and access lists the user 
belongs to.
