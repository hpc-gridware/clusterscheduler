# NAME

xxQS_NAMExx Checkpointing - the xxQS_NAMExx checkpointing mechanism and checkpointing support

# DESCRIPTION

xxQS_NAMExx supports two levels of checkpointing: the user level and a operating system provided transparent level. 
User level checkpointing refers to applications, which do their own checkpointing by writing restart files at certain 
times or algorithmic steps and by properly processing these restart files when restarted.

Transparent checkpointing has to be provided by the operating system and is usually integrated in the operating 
system kernel. 

Checkpointing jobs need to be identified to the xxQS_NAMExx system by using the `-ckpt` option of the qsub(1) command. 
The argument to this flag refers to a so called checkpointing environment, which defines the attributes of the 
checkpointing method to be used (see xxqs_name_sxx_checkpoint(5) for details). Checkpointing environments are set up by the qconf(1)
options `-ackpt`, `-dckpt`, `-mckpt` and `-sckpt`. The qsub(1) option `-c` can be used to overwrite the *when*-attribute for the referenced checkpointing environment.

If a queue is of the type *CHECKPOINTING*, jobs need to have the checkpointing attribute flagged (see the `-ckpt` 
option to qsub(1)) to be permitted to run in such a queue. As opposed to the behavior for regular batch jobs, 
checkpointing jobs are aborted under conditions, for which batch or interactive jobs are suspended or even stay 
unaffected. These conditions are:

-   Explicit suspension of the queue or job via qmod(1) by the cluster administration or a queue owner if the *x* 
    occasion specifier (see qsub(1) `-c` and xxqs_name_sxx_checkpoint(5)) was assigned to the job.

-   A load average value exceeding the suspend threshold as configured for the corresponding queues (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)).

-   Shutdown of the xxQS_NAMExx execution daemon xxqs_name_sxx_execd8(8) being responsible for the checkpointing job.

After abortion, the jobs will migrate to other queues unless they were submitted to one specific queue by an explicit 
user request. The migration of jobs leads to a dynamic load balancing. Note: The abortion of checkpointed jobs will 
free all resources (memory, swap space) which the job occupies at that time. This is opposed to the 
situation for suspended regular jobs, which still cover swap space.

# RESTRICTIONS

When a job migrates to a queue on another machine at present no files are transferred automatically to that machine.
This means that all files which are used throughout the entire job including restart files, executables and scratch 
files must be visible or transferred explicitly (e.g. at the beginning of the job script).

There are also some practical limitations regarding use of disk space for transparently checkpointing jobs. 
Checkpoints of a transparently checkpointed application are usually stored in a checkpoint file or directory by the 
operating system. The file or directory contains all the text, data, and stack space for the process, along with some
additional control information. This means jobs which use a very large virtual address space will generate very 
large checkpoint files. Also the workstations on which the jobs will actually execute may have little free disk 
space. Thus it is not always possible to transfer a transparent checkpointing job to a machine, even though that 
machine is idle. Since large virtual memory jobs must wait for a machine that is both idle, and has a sufficient 
amount of free disk space, such jobs may suffer long turnaround times.
