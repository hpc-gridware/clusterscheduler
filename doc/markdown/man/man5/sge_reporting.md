# NAME

xxqs_name_sxx_reporting - xxQS_NAMExx reporting file format

# DESCRIPTION

A xxQS_NAMExx system writes a reporting file to $SGE_ROOT/default/common/reporting. The reporting file contains data
that can be used for accounting, monitoring and analysis purposes. It contains information about the cluster (hosts, 
queues, load values, consumables, etc.), about the jobs running in the cluster and about sharetree configuration 
and usage. All information is time related, events are dumped to the reporting file in a configurable interval. It
allows to monitor a "real time" status of the cluster as well as historical analysis.

# FORMAT

The reporting file is an ASCII file. Each line contains one record, and the fields of a record are separated by 
a delimiter (:). The reporting file contains records of different type. Each record type has a specific
record structure.

The first two fields are common to all reporting records:

* time  
  Time (GMT unix timestamp) when the record was created.

* record type  
  Type of the accounting record. The different types of records and their structure are described in the following text.

## new_job

The new_job record is written whenever a new job enters the system (usually by a submitting command). It has the 
following fields:

* submission_time  
  Time (GMT unix time stamp) when the job was submitted.

* job_number  
  The job number.

* task_number  
  The array task id. Always has the value -1 for new_job records (as we don't have array tasks yet).

* pe_taskid  
  The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.

* job_name  
  The job name (from -N submission option)

* owner  
  The job owner.

* group  
  The unix group of the job owner.

* project  
  The project the job is running in.

* department  
  The department the job owner is in.

* account  
  The account string specified for the job (from -A submission option).

* priority  
  The job priority (from -p submission option).

## job_log

The job_log record is written whenever a job, an array task or a pe tasks is changing status. A status change 
can be the transition from pending to running, but can also be triggered by user actions like suspension of a job. 
It has the following fields:

* event_time  
  Time (GMT unix time stamp) when the event was generated.

* event  
  A one word description of the event.

* job_number  
  The job number.

* task_number  
  The array task id. Always has the value -1 for new_job records (as we don't have array tasks yet).

* pe_taskid  
  The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.

* state  
  The state of the job after the event was processed.

* user  
  The user who initiated the event (or special usernames "qmaster", "scheduler" and "execd" for actions of the 
  system itself like scheduling jobs, executing jobs etc.).

* host  
  The host from which the action was initiated (e.g. the submit host, the qmaster host, etc.).

* state_time  
  Reserved field for later use.

* submission_time  
  Time (GMT unix time stamp) when the job was submitted.

* job_name  
  The job name (from -N submission option)

* owner  
  The job owner.

* group  
  The unix group of the job owner.

* project  
  The project the job is running in.

* department  
  The department the job owner is in.

* account  
  The account string specified for the job (from -A submission option).

* priority  
  The job priority (from -p submission option).

* message  
  A message describing the reported action.

## acct

Records of type acct are accounting records. Normally, they are written whenever a job, a task of an array job, 
or the task of a parallel job terminates. However, for long-running jobs an intermediate acct record is created 
once a day after a midnight. This results in multiple accounting records for a particular job and allows for a 
fine-grained resource usage monitoring over time. Accounting records comprise the following fields:

* qname  
  Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

* hostname  
  Name of the execution host.

* group  
  The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.

* owner  
  Owner of the xxQS_NAMExx job.

* job_name  
  Job name.

* job_number  
  Job identifier - job number.

* account  
  An account string as specified by the qsub(1) or qalter(1) `-A` option.

* priority  
  Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the *priority* parameter in the queue  
  configuration (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)).

* submission_time  
  Submission time (GMT unix time stamp).

* start_time  
  Start time (GMT unix time stamp).

* end_time  
  End time (GMT unix time stamp).

* failed  
  Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started on the execution host (e.g. because the 
  owner of the job did not have a valid account on that machine). If xxQS_NAMExx tries to start a job multiple times, 
  this may lead to multiple entries in the accounting file corresponding to the same job ID.

* exit_status  
  Exit status of the job script (or xxQS_NAMExx specific status in case of certain error conditions).

* ru_wallclock
  Difference between *end_time* and *start_time* (see above).

  The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents of the standard UNIX rusage structure as described 
  in getrusage(2). Depending on the operating system where the job was executed some of the fields may be 0. The 
  following entries are provided:

    ru_utime
    ru_stime
    ru_maxrss
    ru_ixrss

  `qrsh -inherit` interface.

* maxvmem  
  The maximum vmem size in bytes.

* maxvmem
