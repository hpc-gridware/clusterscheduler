# NAME

xxqs_name_sxx_complex - xxQS_NAMExx complexes configuration file format

# DESCRIPTION

Complex reflects the format of the xxQS_NAMExx complex configuration. The definition of complex attributes provides 
all pertinent information concerning the resource attributes a user may request for a xxQS_NAMExx job via the 
`qsub -l` option and for the interpretation of these parameters within the xxQS_NAMExx system.

The xxQS_NAMExx complex object defines all entries which are used for configuring the global, the host, and queue 
object. The system has a set of predefined entries, which are assigned to a host or queue per default. In an addition 
can the user define new entries and assign them to one or multiple objects. Each load value has to have its 
corresponding complex entry object, which defines the type and the relational operator for it.

## Defining resource attributes

In order to add or modify complex entries (resources), the qconf(1) options `-Mc` and `-mc` can be used. 
While the `-Mc` option takes a complex configuration file as an argument and overrides the current configuration, 
the `-mc` option bring up an editor filled in with a list of all configured resources in a cluster including its
characteristics.

Complex entries can also be created/modified/deleted/shown individually by using the `-ace`/`-mce`/`-dce`/`-sce` 
switches of qconf(1) or one of the files based switches `-Ace` or `-Mce`. The `-scl` switch of qconf(1) just shows
the plain list of complex names without additional characteristics.

The characteristics of a complex are: name, shortcut, type, relop, requestable, consumable, default, and urgency.
Value and meanings are described further down below.

An attribute can only be removed, when it is not referenced in global/host or queue object anymore. The system also has 
a set of default resource attributes which are always attached to a host or queue. They cannot be deleted nor
can the type of such an attribute be changed.

## Working with resource attributes

Before a user can request a resource attribute it has to be attached to the global, host, or cqueue object. The 
resource attribute exists only for the objects, it got attached to:

* If it is attached to the global object (`qconf -me global`), it exits system-wide, 
* host object: only on that host (`qconf -me <host>`) 
* cqueue object: only on that cqueue (`qconf -mq`)).

When the user attached a resource attribute to an object, one also has to assign a value to it; the resource limit. 
Another way to get a resource attribute value is done by configuring a load sensor for that attribute.

## Default host and queue resources

After a default installation the system has a set of predefined resource attributes which are assigned to a host or
queue per default (see xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5)).

The standard set of host related attributes consists of two categories. The first category is built by several queue
configuration attributes which are particularly suitable to be managed on a host basis (like slots, s_vmem, h_vmem, 
s_fsize, h_fsize).

The second attribute category in the standard installations are the default load values. Every xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8)
periodically reports load to xxqs_name_sxx_qmaster(8). The reported load values are either the standard xxQS_NAMExx
load values such as the CPU load average (see uptime(1)) or load values defined by the xxQS_NAMExx administration
(see the *load_sensor* parameter in the cluster configuration xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5) for details). The characteristics
definition for the standard set of load values is part of the default host complex, while administrator defined load
values require extension of the complex list.

Note: Defining resources on global/host level is no contradiction to having them also in the queue configuration. 
It allows maintaining the corresponding resources on a host level and at the same time on a queue level. Total 
virtual free memory (h_vmem) can be managed for a host, for example, and a subset of the total amount can be associated 
with a queue on that host.

## List of default load values

### arch

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The architecture of the host compiled into the xxqs_name_sxx_execd(8)
which describes the platform and architecture for which the execution daemon is targeted: e.g. lx-amd64, lx-arm64,
sol-amd64, lx-riscv64, ...

### cpu

Reported by the execution daemon per default. The percentage of CPU time not in idle state.

### load_avg

Same as load_medium.

### load_long

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The long time average OS run queue length. It is the third of the
value triple reported by the uptime(1) command. Many implementations provide a 15 minute average with this value.

### load_medium

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The medium time average OS run queue length. It is the second of the
value triple reported by the uptime(1) command. Many implementations provide a 5 minute average with this value.

### load_short

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The short time average OS run queue length. It is the first of the 
value triple reported by the uptime(1) command. Many implementations provide a 1 minute average with this value.

### mem_free

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The amount of free memory. See also *mem_used* and *mem_total*.

### mem_total

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The total amount of memory. See also *mem_free* and *mem_used*.

### mem_used

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The amount of used memory. See also *mem_free* and *mem_total*.

### m_core

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The number of CPU cores available per socket on a host. 
See also *num_proc* and *m_socket*.

### m_socket

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The number of sockets on the host. See also *m_core* and *num_proc*.

### m_topology

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The host cpu topology string reported by an execution host. 
Might be a 'NONE' if the topology cannot be determined or it is a string consisting of the upper and lowercase 
letters S, C and c. The sequence of letters within that string represents the hardware topology where S represents a 
socket and C or c a core.

The string "SCCSCCSCCSCC" will returned by a host that has 4 sockets where each of those sockets has two cores.
All cores are available because all C's appear in capital letters.

If lowercase letters are used then this means that the corresponding core is already in use because there is at
least one running job bound to that core. "SCCSCcSCCscc" means that core 2 on socket 2 and also core 1 and core 2 on 
socket 4 are in use.

### np_load_long

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The same as load_long but divided by the number of CPU cores on the
host. This value allows to compare the load of different hosts with different numbers of CPU cores.

### np_load_medium

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The same as load_medium but divided by the number of CPU cores on the
host. This value allows to compare the load of different hosts with different numbers of CPU cores.

### np_load_short

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The same as load_short but divided by the number of CPU cores on the
host. This value allows to compare the load of different hosts with different numbers of CPU cores.

### num_proc

Reported by each execution daemon per default. The number of processors CPU cores available on the host. See also
*m_core* and *m_socket*.

### swap_free

### virtual_used

Calculated value. The amount of used virtual memory. See also *virtual_free* and *virtual_total*.

## Overriding attributes

One attribute can be assigned to the global object, host object, and queue object at the same time. On the host
level it might get its value from the user defined resource limit and a load sensor. In case that the attribute is
a consumable, we have in addition to the resource limit and its load report on host level also the internal usage,
which the system keeps track of. The merge is done as follows:

In general an attribute can be overridden on a lower level

- global by hosts and queues
- hosts by queues and load values or resource limits on the same level.

We have one limitation for overriding attributes based on its relational operator:

!=, == operators can only be overridden on the same level, but not on a lower level. The user defined value always
overrides the load value.

\>=, \>, \<=, \< operators can only be overridden, when the new value is more restrictive than the old one.

In the case of a consumable on host level, which has also a load sensor, the system checks for the current usage, and
if the internal accounting is more restrictive than the load sensor report, the internal value is kept; if the load
sensor report is more restrictive, that one is kept.


# FORMAT

The principal format of a complex configuration is that of a tabulated list. Each line starting with a '#' character 
is a comment line. Each line despite comment lines define one element of the complex. A element definition line 
consists of the following 8 column entries per line (in the order of appearance):

## name

The name of the complex element to be used to request this attribute for a job in the qsub(1) `-l` option. A complex 
attribute name (see *complex_name* in xxqs_name_sxx_types(1)) may appear only once across all complexes, i.e. the 
complex attribute definition is unique.

## shortcut

A shortcut for *name* which may also be used to request this attribute for a job in the qsub(1) `-l` option. An 
attribute *shortcut* may appear only once across all complexes, to avoid the possibility of ambiguous complex 
attribute references.

## type

This setting determines how the corresponding values are to be treated xxQS_NAMExx internally in case of 
comparisons or in case of load scaling for the load complex entries:

-   With *INT* only raw integers are allowed.

-   With *DOUBLE* floating point numbers in double precision (decimal and scientific notation) can be specified.

-   With *TIME* time specifiers are allowed. Refer to xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) for a format description.

-   With *MEMORY* memory size specifiers are allowed. Refer to xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5) for a format description.

-   With *BOOL* the strings *TRUE* and *FALSE* are allowed. When used in a load formula (refer to 
    xxqs_name_sxx_sched_conf(5) ) *TRUE* and *FALSE* get mapped into *1* and *0*.

-   With *STRING* all strings are allowed and is used for wildcard regular boolean expression matching. Please see 
    xxqs_name_sxx_types(1) manpage for *expression* definition.

    Examples:

        -l arch="*x*|sol*"  

    results in "arch=lx-x86" OR "arch=lx-amd64" OR "arch=sol-amd64" OR ... 

        -l arch="sol-x??" 

    results in "arch=sol-x86" OR "arch=sol-x64" OR ...

         -l arch="lx2[246]-x86"

    results in "arch=lx22-x86" OR "arch=lx24-x86"  OR "arch=lx26-x86"

         -l arch="lx2[4-6]-x86" 

    results in "arch=lx24-x86" OR "arch=lx25-x86" OR "arch=lx26-x86"

         -l arch="lx2[24-6]-x86" 

    results in "arch=lx22-x86" OR "arch=lx24-x86" OR "arch=lx25-x86" OR "arch=lx26-x86"

         -l arch="!lx-x86&!sol-amd64"

    results in NEITHER "arch=lx-x86" NOR "arch=sol-amd64"

         -l arch="lx2[4|6]-amd64"

    results in "arch=lx24-amd64" OR "arch=lx26-amd64"  

-   *CSTRING* is like *STRING* except comparisons are case-insensitive.

-   *RESTRING* is like *STRING* and it will be deprecated in the future.

-   *HOST* is like *CSTRING* but the expression must match a valid hostname.

## relop

The relation operator. The relation operator is used when the value requested by the user for this parameter is 
compared against the corresponding value configured for the considered queues. If the result of the comparison is 
false, the job cannot run in this queue. Possible relation operators are "==", "\<", ">", "\<=", ">=" and "EXCL". 
The only valid operator for string type attributes is "==".

The "EXCL" relation operator implements exclusive scheduling and is only valid for consumable boolean type 
attributes. Exclusive means the result of the comparison is only true if a job requests to be exclusive and no
other exclusive or non-exclusive jobs uses the complex. If the job does not request to be exclusive and no other 
exclusive job uses the complex the comparison is also true.

## requestable

The entry can be used in a qsub(1) resource request if this field is set to 'y' or 'yes'. If set to 'n' or 'no' 
this entry cannot be used by a user in order to request a queue or a class of queues. If the entry is set to 'forced' 
or 'f' the attribute has to be requested by a job or it is rejected.

To enable resource request enforcement the existence of the resource has to be defined. This can be done on a cluster 
global, per host and per queue basis. The definition of resource availability is performed with the complex_values 
entry in xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5) and xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5).

## consumable

The consumable parameter can be set to either 'yes' ('y' abbreviated), 'no' ('n'), 'JOB' ('j'), or 'HOST' ('h'). 
It can be set to 'yes', 'JOB', and 'HOST' only for numeric attributes (INT, DOUBLE, MEMORY, TIME - see *type* above). 
If set to 'yes', 'JOB', or 'HOST' the consumption of the corresponding resource can be managed by xxQS_NAMExx internal
bookkeeping. In this case xxQS_NAMExx accounts for the consumption of this resource for all running jobs and ensures 
that jobs are only dispatched if the xxQS_NAMExx internal bookkeeping indicates enough available consumable 
resources. Consumables are an efficient means to manage limited resources such as available memory, free space on 
a file system, network bandwidth or floating software licenses.

A consumable defined by 'YES' is a per slot consumables which means the limit is multiplied by the number of 
slots being used by the job before being applied. In case of 'JOB' the consumable is a per job consumable.
This resource is debited as requested (without multiplication) from the allocated master queue or the host the 
master task is running on. The resource needs not be available for the slave task queues / hosts. 'HOST' consumables 
are per host consumables. Their capacity can only be defined on exechost or global level (not on queue level), 
the requested amount of such a resource is debited once per host running one or multiple tasks of a job.

Consumables can be combined with default or user defined load parameters (see xxqs_name_sxx_conf(5) and 
xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5)), i.e. load values can be reported for consumable attributes or the consumable flag can 
be set for load attributes. The xxQS_NAMExx consumable resource management takes both the load (measuring availability 
of the resource) and the internal bookkeeping into account in this case, and makes sure that neither of both exceeds 
a given limit.

To enable consumable resource management the basic availability of a resource has to be defined. This can be done 
on a cluster global, per host and per queue basis while these categories may supersede each other in the given order 
(i.e. a host can restrict availability of a cluster resource and a queue can restrict host and cluster resources). The
definition of resource availability is performed with the *complex_values* entry in xxqs_name_sxx_host_conf(5) and 
xxqs_name_sxx_queue_conf(5). The *complex_values* definition of the "global" host specifies cluster global consumable 
settings. To each consumable complex attribute in a *complex_values* list a value is assigned which denotes the maximum
available amount for that resource. The internal bookkeeping will subtract from this total the assumed resource 
consumption by all running jobs as expressed through the jobs resource requests.

Note: Jobs can be forced to request a resource and thus to specify their assumed consumption via the 'force' value 
of the *requestable* parameter (see above).

Note also: A default resource consumption value can be pre-defined by the administrator for consumable attributes 
not explicitly requested by the job (see the *default* parameter below). This is meaningful only if requesting the 
attribute is not enforced as explained above.

## default

Meaningful only for consumable complex attributes (see *consumable* parameter above). xxQS_NAMExx assumes the 
resource amount denoted in the *default* parameter implicitly to be consumed by jobs being dispatched
to a host or queue managing the consumable attribute. Jobs explicitly requesting the attribute via the `-l` 
option to qsub(1) override this default value.

## urgency

The urgency value allows influencing job priorities on a per resource base. The urgency value effects the addend 
for each resource when determining the resource request related urgency contribution. For numeric type resource 
requests the addend is the product of the urgency value, the jobs assumed slot allocation and the per slot request as
specified via `-l` option to qsub(1). For string type requests the resources urgency value is directly used as 
addend. Urgency values are of type real. See under xxqs_name_sxx_priority(5) for an overview on job priorities.
