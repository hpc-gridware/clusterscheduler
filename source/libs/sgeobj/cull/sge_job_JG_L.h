/**
* @brief Job Granted Destination Identifier
*
* A list of such objects defines to which queue instance(s) a job has been scheduled.
* For sequential jobs / tasks of an array job there is a single object of JG_Type.
* In case of tightly integrated parallel jobs there is an object per queue instance.
* The first object defines where the master task of the job is running.
*
*    SGE_STRING(JG_qname) - Queue Instance Name
*    The queue instance name.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(JG_qversion) - Queue Version
*    The qinstance's version. Is used to detect when a qinstance was changed during scheduling.
*
*    SGE_HOST(JG_qhostname) - Qualified Hostname
*    The qualified host name of the queue instance.
*    It is redundand (cached) information also contained in qname.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(JG_slots) - Number of Slots
*    The amount of slots the job occupies in the queue instance.
*    Always 1 for sequential jobs / tasks of array jobs, >= 1 for parallel jobs
*
*    SGE_OBJECT(JG_queue) - Queue Object
*    The queue instance definition with information required in sge_execd,
*    like limits, the tmp directory, ...
*
*    SGE_ULONG(JG_tag_slave_job) - Tag for Slave Job Delivery
*    Tag used in the job delivery protocol, is set when a slave host acknowledged receipt of the start order.
*
*    SGE_DOUBLE(JG_ticket) - Total Tickets
*    Total amount of tickets assigned to slots.
*
*    SGE_DOUBLE(JG_oticket) - Override Tickets
*    Override tickets assigned to slots.
*
*    SGE_DOUBLE(JG_fticket) - Functional Tickets
*    Functional tickets assigned to slots.
*
*    SGE_DOUBLE(JG_sticket) - Sharetree Tickets
*    Sharetree tickets assigned to slots.
*
*    SGE_DOUBLE(JG_jcoticket) - Job Class Override Tickets
*    Job class override tickets.
*
*    SGE_DOUBLE(JG_jcfticket) - Job Class Functional Tickets
*    Job class functional tickets.
*
*    SGE_STRING(JG_processors) - Processor Set
*    Processor set the job is supposed to run on (Solaris only?)
