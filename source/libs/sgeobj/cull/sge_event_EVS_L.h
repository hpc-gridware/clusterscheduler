/**
* @brief Event Subscription
*
* An object of the EventSubscription type specifies if a certain event is subscribed
* and additional information for flushing and filtering
* see also the documentation in source/libs/evc/sge_event_client.cc
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EVS_id) - Event Id
*    The Id of the specific event from enumeration type ev_event (libs/sgeobj/sge_event.h), e.g.
*      - sgeE_ADMIN_HOST_LIST
*      - sgeE_ADMIN_HOST_ADD
*      - sgeE_ADMIN_HOST_DEL
*      - sgeE_ADMIN_HOST_MOD
*      - sgeE_CALENDAR_LIST
*      - ...
*
*    SGE_BOOL(EVS_flush) - Flush this Event
*    Specifies if flushing of the event is enabled. This means that flushing of events is triggered
*    if this event will be delivered to a specific event client.
*    Flushing of event data means that the event are sent to the client earlier than forseen
*    by the event client's event delivery interval.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EVS_interval) - Flushing Interval
*    Flushing interval in seconds.
*    Events will be sent to the event client not later than current time + interval.
*
*    SGE_OBJECT(EVS_what) - Attribute Filter
*    Enumeration defining which attributes of an object will be sent to the event client (reduced objects).
*    We can for example configure: We are only interested in job id, job name and job owner.
*
*    SGE_OBJECT(EVS_where) - Object Filter
*    Condition filtering objects to be sent.
*    We can for example configure: Send only events for jobs of user xyz.
