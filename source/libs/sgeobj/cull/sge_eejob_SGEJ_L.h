/**
* @brief Job Sort Object
*
* This is the list type we use to sort the joblist in the sge scheduler.
* The list will be build before the actual scheduling.
* It is sorted by priorty ASC, submission time ASC, job number DESC.
* Jobs in this list will then be scheduled one after the other.
*
*    SGE_DOUBLE(SGEJ_priority) - Priority
*    Normalized priority of the job/array task after applying all policies.
*    The job list is sorted by priority descending as primary sort criterion.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(SGEJ_job_number) - Job Number
*    The job number. Third sort criterion.
*
*    SGE_STRING(SGEJ_job_name) - Job Name
*    The job name.
*    @todo can be removed, it is only set, never read.
*
*    SGE_STRING(SGEJ_owner) - Owner
*    The job owner.
*    @todo can be removed, it is only set, never read.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(SGEJ_state) - State
*    The state of an enrolled array task (JAT_state).
*    @todo can be removed, it is only set, never read.
*
*    SGE_STRING(SGEJ_master_queue) - Master Queue
*    The master queue of an enrolled array task (JAT_master_queue).
*    @todo can be removed, it is only set, never read.
*
*    SGE_REF(SGEJ_job_reference) - Job Reference
*    Reference (Pointer) to the job in the scheduler's job list.
*
*    SGE_ULONG64(SGEJ_submission_time) - Submission Time
*    The job submission time. Secondary sort criterion.
