/**
* @brief Event Client
*
* An object of the event client type represents one event client.
* For more information about the event client interface see the documentation in
* source/libs/evc/sge_event_client.cc
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_id) - event client id
*    Unique id requested by client or given by qmaster
*
*    SGE_STRING(EV_name) - event client name
*    name of event client (non unique)
*
*    SGE_HOST(EV_host) - event client address: host name
*    Commlib address: The host name where the event client is running
*
*    SGE_STRING(EV_commproc) - event client address: commproc
*    Commlib address: The process name, e.g. qsub for the qsub -sync y event client
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_commid) - event client address: commid
*    Commlib address: A unique id assigned by the sge_qmaster commlib
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_uid) - user id
*    The user id of the user who started the event client.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_d_time) - event delivery interval
*    The time interval in seconds in which an event package is delivered to the client.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_flush_delay) - flush delay
*    @todo is it actually used? Used for throttling of the event flushing mechanism (?)
*
*    SGE_LIST(EV_subscribed) - subscribed events
*    a list of subscribed events
*
*    SGE_BOOL(EV_changed) - event client changed?
*    true, if any configuration information of the event client has been changed.
*    Requires then updating the event client information in the event master
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_busy_handling) - busy handling
*    Defines how the event master shall deal with busy event clients.
*
*    SGE_STRING(EV_session) - session key
*    Session key used tfor filtering subscribed events, used with job submission via the DRMAA interface
*
*    SGE_ULONG64(EV_last_heard_from) - last heard from
*    Timestamp (microseconds since epoch) of the last communication between event client and event master.
*
*    SGE_ULONG64(EV_last_send_time) - last send time
*    Timestamp (microseconds since epoch) when the last event package was sent to the event client.
*
*    SGE_ULONG64(EV_next_send_time) - next send time
*    Timestamp (microseconds since epoch) when the next event package shall be sent to the event client.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_next_number) - next event serial number
*    Serial number of the next event which will be sent to the event client.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_busy) - busy
*    true if the event client is considered busy, else false.
*    no events will be sent to a busy client
*
*    SGE_LIST(EV_events) - events to be sent
*    List of events which will next be delivered to the event client.
*
*    SGE_REF(EV_sub_array) - subscription array
*    Subscription information used in event master only.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(EV_state) - event client state
*    State of the event client, e.g. connected, closing, terminated.
*
*    SGE_REF(EV_update_function) - update function
*    Pointer to an update function used for updating internal event clients (threads in sge_qmaster).
*
*    SGE_REF(EV_update_function_arg) - update function argument
*    Pointer that is passed to the update_function when it is called.
*    The pointer can be specified during mirror/evc initialize.
