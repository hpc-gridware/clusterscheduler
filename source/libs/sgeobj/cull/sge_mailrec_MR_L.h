/**
* @brief Mail Receiver
*
* One object of this type specifies a mail receiver, meaning an email address
* in the form user@host.
* It is used e.g. when submitting jobs via qsub -M user[@host][,user[@host],...]
* @todo why do we split it into user and host? We could just have a single string holding an email address.
*
*    SGE_STRING(MR_user) - User Name
*    User name of the mail receipient
*
*    SGE_HOST(MR_host) - Host Name
*    Host / Domain part of a mail receipient.
