/**
* @brief Path Name
*
* An object of the PathName type specifies a certain path on a host.
* It is used for specifying stdin/stdout/stderr paths via submit options -i/-o/-e/-j.
* For different hosts different paths can be specified in the form [host:]path[,[host:]path...].
* There is some simple file staging facility, to be evaluated.
*
*    SGE_STRING(PN_path) - Path
*    Path to a file or directory.
*
*    SGE_HOST(PN_host) - Host Name
*    Name of the host where this specification is valid.
*    If it is left empty (nullptr), then the path is valid on all hosts (default).
*
*    SGE_HOST(PN_file_host) - File Host
*    @todo for file staging, the host where the file is available?
*
*    SGE_BOOL(PN_file_staging) - Do File Staging
*    Do file staging when set to true. @todo status of filestaging?
