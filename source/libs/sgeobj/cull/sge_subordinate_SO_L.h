/**
* @brief SubordinateQueue
*
* Subordinate (queue instances) are defined in a sub list of a queue instance.
* We want to use the configuration parameter subordinate_list
* for both the classic queue instance-wise suspend on subordinate
* and the slot-wise suspend on subordinate.
* The fields SO_name and SO_threshold are used by the queue instance-wise
* suspend on subordinate, SO_name, SO_slots_sum, SO_seq_no and SO_action
* are used by the slot-wise suspend on subordinate.
* If SO_slots_sum is 0, it's queue instance-wise, otherwise slot-wise
* suspend on subordinate that is configured.
*
*    SGE_STRING(SO_name) - Subordinate Queue Name
*    Name of the subordinate queue.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(SO_threshold) - Threshold
*    The threshold (slots) defines when the subordination action (suspend) will be triggered.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(SO_slots_sum) - Slots Sum
*    Used for slot-wise SOS.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(SO_seq_no) - Sequence Number
*    Used for slot-wise SOS.
*
*    SGE_ULONG(SO_action) - Action
*    Subordination action, ussed for slot-wise SOS:
*    - SO_ACTION_SR: suspend the task with the shortest runtime
*    - SO_ACTION_LR: suspend the task with the longest runtime
